    <p>
      R<span class="fss">ICHARD</span> H<span class="fss">ARDING</span> D<span
      class="fss">AVIS</span>, as a friend and fellow author has written of him,
      was &#8220;youth incarnate,&#8221; and there is probably nothing that he
      wrote of which a boy would not some day come to feel the appeal. But there
      are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boy&#8217;s
      heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature. A
      few of these were made some years ago into a volume, &#8220;Stories for
      Boys,&#8221; and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition
      to Davis&#8217;s general readers; and the present collection from stories
      more recently published is issued with the same motive. This book takes
      its title from &#8220;The Boy Scout,&#8221; the first of its tales; and it
      includes &#8220;The Boy Who Cried Wolf,&#8221; &#8220;Blood Will Tell,&#8221;
      the immortal &#8220;Gallegher,&#8221; and &#8220;The Bar Sinister,&#8221;
      Davis&#8217;s famous dog story. It is a fresh volume added to what
      Augustus Thomas calls &#8220;safe stuff to give to a young fellow who
      likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his
      face.&#8221;

      <a id="link_1"></a>THE BOY SCOUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Rule of the Boy Scouts is every day to do some one a good turn. Not
      because the copy-books tell you it deserves another, but in spite of that
      pleasing possibility. If you are a true Scout, until you have performed
      your act of kindness your day is dark. You are as unhappy as is the
      grown-up who has begun his day without shaving or reading the New York <i>Sun</i>.
      But as soon as you have proved yourself you may, with a clear conscience,
      look the world in the face and untie the knot in your kerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie Reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten minutes
      past eight on a hot August morning after he had given one dime to his
      sister Sadie. With that she could either witness the first-run films at
      the Palace, or by dividing her fortune patronize two of the nickel shows
      on Lenox Avenue. The choice Jimmie left to her. He was setting out for the
      annual encampment of the Boy Scouts at Hunter&#8217;s Island, and in the
      excitement of that adventure even the movies ceased to thrill. But Sadie
      also could be unselfish. With a heroism of a camp-fire maiden she made a
      gesture which might have been interpreted to mean she was returning the
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t, Jimmie!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I can&#8217;t take
      it off you. You saved it, and you ought to get the fun of it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t saved it yet,&#8221; said Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;m
      going to cut it out of the railroad fare. I&#8217;m going to get off at
      City Island instead of at Pelham Manor and walk the difference. That&#8217;s
      ten cents cheaper.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadie exclaimed with admiration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;An&#8217; you carryin&#8217; that heavy grip!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Aw, that&#8217;s nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said the man of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Good-by, mother. So long, Sadie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      To ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised Sadie to
      take in &#8220;The Curse of Cain&#8221; rather than &#8220;The Mohawks&#8217;
      Last Stand,&#8221; and fled down the front steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore his khaki uniform. On his shoulders was his knapsack, from his
      hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his &#8220;shorts&#8221;
      his kneecaps, unkissed by the sun, as yet unscathed by blackberry vines,
      showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl. As he moved toward
      the &#8220;L&#8221; station at the corner, Sadie and his mother waved to
      him; in the street, boys too small to be Scouts hailed him enviously; even
      the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the news-stand nodded
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You a Scout, Jimmie?&#8221; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No,&#8221; retorted Jimmie, for was not he also in uniform? &#8220;I&#8217;m
      Santa Claus out filling Christmas stockings.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The patrolman also possessed a ready wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then get yourself a pair,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;If a dog was to
      see your legs&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the Elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, with his valise in one hand and staff in the other, he was
      tramping up the Boston Post Road and breathing heavily. The day was
      cruelly hot. Before his eyes, over an interminable stretch of asphalt, the
      heat waves danced and flickered. Already the knapsack on his shoulders
      pressed upon him like an Old Man of the Sea; the linen in the valise had
      turned to pig iron, his pipe-stem legs were wabbling, his eyes smarted
      with salt sweat, and the fingers supporting the valise belonged to some
      other boy, and were giving that boy much pain. But as the motor-cars
      flashed past with raucous warnings, or, that those who rode might better
      see the boy with bare knees, passed at &#8220;half speed,&#8221; Jimmie
      stiffened his shoulders and stepped jauntily forward. Even when the
      joy-riders mocked with &#8220;Oh, you Scout!&#8221; he smiled at them. He
      was willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who
      walked. And he regretted&#8211;oh, so bitterly&#8211;having left the
      train. He was indignant that for his &#8220;one good turn a day&#8221; he
      had not selected one less strenuous. That, for instance, he had not
      assisted a frightened old lady through the traffic. To refuse the dime she
      might have offered, as all true Scouts refuse all tips, would have been
      easier than to earn it by walking five miles, with the sun at ninety-nine
      degrees, and carrying excess baggage. Twenty times James shifted the
      valise to the other hand, twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as again he took up his burden, the Good Samaritan drew near. He
      drew near in a low gray racing-car at the rate of forty miles an hour, and
      within a hundred feet of Jimmie suddenly stopped and backed toward him.
      The Good Samaritan was a young man with white hair. He wore a suit of
      blue, a golf cap; the hands that held the wheel were disguised in large
      yellow gloves. He brought the car to a halt and surveyed the dripping
      figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You a Boy Scout?&#8221; he asked.
    </p>

        Jimmie dropped the valise, forced his cramped fingers into straight
        lines, and saluted.

    </div>
    <!--  figure -->
    <p>
      With alacrity for the twenty-first time Jimmie dropped the valise, forced
      his cramped fingers into straight lines, and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Get in,&#8221; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When James sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man, to Jimmie&#8217;s
      disappointment, did not continue to shatter the speed limit. Instead, he
      seemed inclined for conversation, and the car, growling indignantly,
      crawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I never saw a Boy Scout before,&#8221; announced the old young man.
      &#8220;Tell me about it. First, tell me what you do when you&#8217;re not
      scouting.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie explained volubly. When not in uniform he was an office-boy and
      from pedlers and beggars guarded the gates of Carroll and Hastings,
      stock-brokers. He spoke the names of his employers with awe. It was a firm
      distinguished, conservative, and long-established. The white-haired young
      man seemed to nod in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you know them?&#8221; demanded Jimmie suspiciously. &#8220;Are
      you a customer of ours?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know them,&#8221; said the young man. &#8220;They are customers
      of mine.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie wondered in what way Carroll and Hastings were customers of the
      white-haired young man. Judging him by his outer garments, Jimmie guessed
      he was a Fifth Avenue tailor; he might be even a haberdasher. Jimmie
      continued. He lived, he explained, with his mother at One Hundred and
      Forty-sixth Street; Sadie, his sister, attended the public school; he
      helped support them both, and he now was about to enjoy a well-earned
      vacation camping out on Hunter&#8217;s Island, where he would cook his own
      meals and, if the mosquitoes permitted, sleep in a tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And you like that?&#8221; demanded the young man. &#8220;You call
      that fun?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sure!&#8221; protested Jimmie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>you</i> go
      camping out?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I go camping out,&#8221; said the Good Samaritan, &#8220;whenever I
      leave New York.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie had not for three years lived in Wall Street not to understand that
      the young man spoke in metaphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t look,&#8221; objected the young man critically,
      &#8220;as though you were built for the strenuous life.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You ought ter see me two weeks from now,&#8221; he protested.
      &#8220;I get all sunburnt and hard&#8211;hard as anything!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You were near getting sunstroke when I picked you up,&#8221; he
      laughed. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to Hunter&#8217;s Island why didn&#8217;t
      you take the Third Avenue to Pelham Manor?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; assented Jimmie eagerly. &#8220;But I
      wanted to save the ten cents so&#8217;s to send Sadie to the movies. So I
      walked.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jimmie did not hear him. From the back of the car he was dragging
      excitedly at the hated suitcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I got ter get out. I got ter <i>walk</i>.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man showed his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Walk!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What is it&#8211;a bet?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway. It took some
      time to explain to the young man. First, he had to be told about the scout
      law and the one good turn a day, and that it must involve some personal
      sacrifice. And, as Jimmie pointed out, changing from a slow suburban train
      to a racing-car could not be listed as a sacrifice. He had not earned the
      money, Jimmie argued; he had only avoided paying it to the railroad. If he
      did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude of Sadie by a falsehood.
      Therefore, he must walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not at all,&#8221; protested the young man. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
      it wrong. What good will it do your sister to have you sunstruck? I think
      you <i>are</i> sunstruck. You&#8217;re crazy with the heat. You get in
      here, and we&#8217;ll talk it over as we go along.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily Jimmie backed away. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather walk,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shifted his legs irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then how&#8217;ll this suit you?&#8221; he called. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
      declare that first &#8216;one good turn&#8217; a failure and start afresh.
      Do me a good turn.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Hunter&#8217;s Island Inn,&#8221; called the
      young man, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve lost my way. You get in here and guide
      me. That&#8217;ll be doing me a good turn.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side of the road, blotting out the landscape, giant hands picked
      out in electric-light bulbs pointed the way to Hunter&#8217;s Island Inn.
      Jimmie grinned and nodded toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; he called, &#8220;I got ter walk.&#8221;
      Turning his back upon temptation, he wabbled forward into the flickering
      heat waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not attempt to pursue. At the side of the road, under
      the shade of a giant elm, he had brought the car to a halt and with his
      arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless, following with frowning eyes
      the retreating figure of Jimmie. But the narrow-chested and knock-kneed
      boy staggering over the sun-baked asphalt no longer concerned him. It was
      not Jimmie, but the code preached by Jimmie, and not only preached but
      before his eyes put into practice, that interested him. The young man with
      white hair had been running away from temptation. At forty miles an hour
      he had been running away from the temptation to do a fellow mortal &#8220;a
      good turn.&#8221; That morning, to the appeal of a drowning Cæsar to
      &#8220;Help me, Cassius, or I sink,&#8221; he had answered, &#8220;Sink!&#8221;
      That answer he had no wish to reconsider. That he might not reconsider he
      had sought to escape. It was his experience that a sixty-horse-power
      racing-machine is a jealous mistress. For retrospective, sentimental, or
      philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence. But he had not
      escaped. Jimmie had halted him, tripped him by the heels and set him again
      to thinking. Within the half-hour that followed those who rolled past saw
      at the side of the road a car with her engine running, and leaning upon
      the wheel, as unconscious of his surroundings as though he sat at his own
      fireplace, a young man who frowned and stared at nothing. The half-hour
      passed and the young man swung his car back toward the city. But at the
      first roadhouse that showed a blue-and-white telephone sign he left it,
      and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a nickel. He wished to
      communicate with Mr. Carroll, of Carroll and Hastings; and when he learned
      Mr. Carroll had just issued orders that he must not be disturbed, the
      young man gave his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect upon the barkeeper was instantaneous. With the aggrieved air of
      one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully. &#8220;What
      are you putting over?&#8221; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled reassuringly. He had begun to speak and, though
      apparently engaged with the beer-glass he was polishing, the barkeeper
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in Wall Street the senior member of Carroll and Hastings also
      listened. He was alone in the most private of all his private offices, and
      when interrupted had been engaged in what, of all undertakings, is the
      most momentous. On the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer, to the
      coroner, to his wife; and hidden by a mass of papers, but within reach of
      his hand, an automatic pistol. The promise it offered of swift release had
      made the writing of the letters simple, had given him a feeling of
      complete detachment, had released him, at least in thought, from all
      responsibilities. And when at his elbow the telephone coughed discreetly,
      it was as though some one had called him from a world from which already
      he had made his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically, through mere habit, he lifted the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That letter I sent this morning? Forget it. Tear it up. I&#8217;ve
      been thinking and I&#8217;m going to take a chance. I&#8217;ve decided to
      back you boys, and I know you&#8217;ll make good. I&#8217;m speaking from
      a roadhouse in the Bronx; going straight from here to the bank. So you can
      begin to draw against us within an hour. And&#8211;hello!&#8211;will three
      millions see you through?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      From Wall Street there came no answer, but from the hands of the barkeeper
      a glass crashed to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t answer,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He must have
      hung up.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He must have fainted!&#8221; said the barkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white-haired one pushed a bill across the counter. &#8220;To pay for
      breakage,&#8221; he said, and disappeared down Pelham Parkway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the day, with the bill, for evidence, pasted against the
      mirror, the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He stood just where you&#8217;re standing now,&#8221; he related,
      &#8220;blowing in million-dollar bills like you&#8217;d blow suds off a
      beer. If I&#8217;d knowed it was <i>him</i>, I&#8217;d have hit him once,
      and hid him in the cellar for the reward. Who&#8217;d I think he was? I
      thought he was a wire-tapper, working a con game!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll had not &#8220;hung up,&#8221; but when in the Bronx the
      beer-glass crashed, in Wall Street the receiver had slipped from the hand
      of the man who held it, and the man himself had fallen forward. His desk
      hit him in the face and woke him&#8211;woke him to the wonderful fact that
      he still lived; that at forty he had been born again; that before him
      stretched many more years in which, as the young man with the white hair
      had pointed out, he still could make good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was far advanced when the staff of Carroll and Hastings were
      allowed to depart, and, even late as was the hour, two of them were asked
      to remain. Into the most private of the private offices Carroll invited
      Gaskell, the head clerk; in the main office Hastings had asked young
      Thorne, the bond clerk, to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the senior partner has finished with Gaskell young Thorne must
      remain seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gaskell,&#8221; said Mr. Carroll, &#8220;if we had listened to you,
      if we&#8217;d run this place as it was when father was alive, this never
      would have happened. It <i>hasn&#8217;t</i> happened, but we&#8217;ve had
      our lesson. And after this we&#8217;re going slow and going straight. And
      we don&#8217;t need you to tell us how to do that. We want you to go away&#8211;on
      a month&#8217;s vacation. When I thought we were going under I planned to
      send the children on a sea-voyage with the governess&#8211;so they wouldn&#8217;t
      see the newspapers. But now that I can look them in the eye again, I need
      them, I can&#8217;t let them go. So, if you&#8217;d like to take your wife
      on an ocean trip to Nova Scotia and Quebec, here are the cabins I reserved
      for the kids. They call it the Royal Suite&#8211;whatever that is&#8211;and
      the trip lasts a month. The boat sails to-morrow morning. Don&#8217;t
      sleep too late or you may miss her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      The head clerk was secreting the tickets in the inside pocket of his
      waistcoat. His fingers trembled, and when he laughed his voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Miss the boat!&#8221; the head clerk exclaimed. &#8220;If she gets
      away from Millie and me she&#8217;s got to start now. We&#8217;ll go on
      board to-night!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later Millie was on her knees packing a trunk, and her husband
      was telephoning to the drug-store for a sponge bag and a cure for
      sea-sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on her knees,
      Millie was alternately weeping into the trunk-tray and offering up
      incoherent prayers of thanksgiving. Suddenly she sank back upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;John!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t it seem sinful to sail
      away in a &#8216;royal suite&#8217; and leave this beautiful flat empty?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the telephone John was having trouble with the drug clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No!&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sea-sick <i>now</i>.
      The medicine I want is to be taken later. I <i>know</i> I&#8217;m speaking
      from the Pavonia; but the Pavonia isn&#8217;t a ship; it&#8217;s an
      apartment-house.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Millie. &#8220;We can&#8217;t be in two places at the same
      time,&#8221; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But, think,&#8221; insisted Millie, &#8220;of all the poor people
      stifling to-night in this heat, trying to sleep on the roofs and
      fire-escapes; and our flat so cool and big and pretty&#8211;and no one in
      it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded his head proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know it&#8217;s big,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t
      big enough to hold all the people who are sleeping to-night on the roofs
      and in the parks.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was thinking of your brother&#8211;and Grace,&#8221; said Millie.
      &#8220;They&#8217;ve been married only two weeks now, and they&#8217;re in
      a stuffy hall bedroom and eating with all the other boarders. Think what
      our flat would mean to them; to be by themselves, with eight rooms and
      their own kitchen and bath, and our new refrigerator and the gramophone!
      It would be Heaven! It would be a real honeymoon!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoning the drug clerk, John lifted Millie in his arms and kissed her,
      for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      The younger brother and Grace were sitting on the stoop of the
      boarding-house. On the upper steps, in their shirt-sleeves, were the other
      boarders; so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers. The air of the
      cross street was stale and stagnant; from it rose exhalations of rotting
      fruit, the gases of an open subway, the smoke of passing taxicabs. But
      between the street and the hall bedroom, with its odors of a gas-stove and
      a kitchen, the choice was difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to cool off somehow,&#8221; the young husband was
      saying, &#8220;or you won&#8217;t sleep. Shall we treat ourselves to
      ice-cream sodas or a trip on the Weehawken ferry-boat?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The ferry-boat!&#8221; begged the girl, &#8220;where we can get
      away from all these people.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street, kicked itself to
      a stop, and the head clerk and Millie spilled out upon the pavement. They
      talked so fast, and the younger brother and Grace talked so fast, that the
      boarders, although they listened intently, could make nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They distinguished only the concluding sentences:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you drive down to the wharf with us,&#8221; they
      heard the elder brother ask, &#8220;and see our royal suite?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the younger brother laughed him to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s your royal suite,&#8221; he mocked, &#8220;to our
      royal palace?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head
      clerk, they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling murmur
      of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of &#8220;Alexander&#8217;s
      Ragtime Band.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When in his private office Carroll was making a present of the royal suite
      to the head clerk, in the main office Hastings, the junior partner, was
      addressing &#8220;Champ&#8221; Thorne, the bond clerk. He addressed him
      familiarly and affectionately as &#8220;Champ.&#8221; This was due partly
      to the fact that twenty-six years before Thorne had been christened
      Champneys and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven
      of one of the Big Three to the championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Champ,&#8221; said Mr. Hastings, &#8220;last month, when you asked
      me to raise your salary, the reason I didn&#8217;t do it was not because
      you didn&#8217;t deserve it, but because I believed if we gave you a raise
      you&#8217;d immediately get married.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoulders of the ex-football captain rose aggressively; he snorted
      with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And why should I <i>not</i> get married?&#8221; he demanded.
      &#8220;You&#8217;re a fine one to talk! You&#8217;re the most offensively
      happy married man I ever met.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps I know I am happy better than you do,&#8221; reproved the
      junior partner; &#8220;but I know also that it takes money to support a
      wife.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You raise me to a hundred a week,&#8221; urged Champ, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
      make it support a wife whether it supports me or not.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A month ago,&#8221; continued Hastings, &#8220;we could have <i>promised</i>
      you a hundred, but we didn&#8217;t know how long we could pay it. We didn&#8217;t
      want you to rush off and marry some fine girl&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Some fine girl!&#8221; muttered Mr. Thorne. &#8220;The Finest Girl!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The finer the girl,&#8221; Hastings pointed out, &#8220;the harder
      it would have been for you if we had failed and you had lost your job.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the young man opened with sympathy and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is it as bad as that?&#8221; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastings sighed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It <i>was</i>,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but this morning the Young
      Man of Wall Street did us a good turn&#8211;saved us&#8211;saved our
      creditors, saved our homes, saved our honor. We&#8217;re going to start
      fresh and pay our debts, and we agreed the first debt we paid would be the
      small one we owe you. You&#8217;ve brought us more than we&#8217;ve given,
      and if you&#8217;ll stay with us we&#8217;re going to &#8216;see&#8217;
      your fifty and raise it a hundred. What do you say?&#8221;
    </p>

      Young Mr. Thorne leaped to his feet. What he said was: &#8220;Where&#8217;n
      hell&#8217;s my hat?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I say, &#8216;thank you a thousand times,&#8217;&#8221; he shouted
      over his shoulder. &#8220;Excuse me, but I&#8217;ve got to go. I&#8217;ve
      got to break the news to&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not explain to whom he was going to break the news; but Hastings
      must have guessed, for again he sighed happily and then, a little
      hysterically, laughed aloud. Several months had passed since he had
      laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his anxiety to break the news Champ Thorne almost broke his neck. In
      his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the
      elevator was going down or coming up, and sooner than wait to find out he
      started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the
      elevator-door swung open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You get five dollars,&#8221; he announced to the elevator man,
      &#8220;if you drop to the street without a stop. Beat the speed limit! Act
      like the building is on fire and you&#8217;re trying to save me before the
      roof falls.&#8221;

      Senator Barnes and his entire family, which was his daughter Barbara, were
      at the Ritz-Carlton. They were in town in August because there was a
      meeting of the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber Company, of which
      company Senator Barnes was president. It was a secret meeting. Those
      directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been summoned
      by telegraph; those who were steaming across the ocean, by wireless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal, sickening, grim,
      terrible. As yet it burned beneath the surface, giving out only an odor,
      but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself. At any moment it might break
      into flame. For the directors, was it the better wisdom to let the scandal
      smoulder, and take a chance, or to be the first to give the alarm, the
      first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to decide this that, in the heat of August, the directors and the
      president had foregathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Champ Thorne knew nothing of this; he knew only that by a miracle Barbara
      Barnes was in town; that at last he was in a position to ask her to marry
      him; that she would certainly say she would. That was all he cared to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year before he had issued his declaration of independence. Before he
      could marry, he told her, he must be able to support a wife on what he
      earned, without her having to accept money from her father, and until he
      received &#8220;a minimum wage&#8221; of five thousand dollars they must
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is the matter with my father&#8217;s money?&#8221; Barbara had
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorne had evaded the direct question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There is too much of it,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you object to the way he makes it?&#8221; insisted Barbara.
      &#8220;Because rubber is most useful. You put it in golf balls and auto
      tires and galoches. There is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoches.
      And what is there &#8216;tainted&#8217; about a raincoat?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorne shook his head unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not the finished product to which I refer,&#8221; he
      stammered; &#8220;it&#8217;s the way they get the raw material.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They get it out of trees,&#8221; said Barbara. Then she exclaimed
      with enlightenment&#8213;&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you are
      thinking of the Congo. There it is terrible! <i>That</i> is slavery. But
      there are no slaves on the Amazon. The natives are free and the work is
      easy. They just tap the trees the way the farmers gather sugar in Vermont.
      Father has told me about it often.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorne had made no comment. He could abuse a friend, if the friend were
      among those present, but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as he
      disliked Senator Barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to
      others. And he knew besides that, if the father she loved and the man she
      loved distrusted each other, Barbara would not rest until she learned the
      reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, in a newspaper, Barbara read of the Puju Mayo atrocities, of the
      Indian slaves in the jungles and back waters of the Amazon, who are
      offered up as sacrifices to &#8220;red rubber.&#8221; She carried the
      paper to her father. What it said, her father told her, was untrue, and if
      it were true it was the first he had heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Barnes loved the good things of life, but the thing he loved most
      was his daughter; the thing he valued the highest was her good opinion. So
      when for the first time she looked at him in doubt, he assured her he at
      once would order an investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But, of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it will be many months
      before our agents can report. On the Amazon news travels very slowly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that that is true.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was six months before the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber
      Company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the
      Ritz-Carlton. They were due to arrive in half an hour, and while Senator
      Barnes awaited their coming Barbara came to him. In her eyes was a light
      that helped to tell the great news. It gave him a sharp, jealous pang. He
      wanted at once to play a part in her happiness, to make her grateful to
      him, not alone to this stranger who was taking her away. So fearful was he
      that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for half his
      kingdom he would have parted with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And besides giving my consent,&#8221; said the rubber king, &#8220;for
      which no one seems to have asked, what can I give my little girl to make
      her remember her old father? Some diamonds to put on her head, or pearls
      to hang around her neck, or does she want a vacant lot on Fifth Avenue?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely hands of Barbara rested upon his shoulders; her lovely face was
      raised to his; her lovely eyes were appealing, and a little frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What would one of those things cost?&#8221; asked Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was eminently practical. It came within the scope of the
      senator&#8217;s understanding. After all, he was not to be cast into outer
      darkness. His smile was complacent. He answered airily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Anything you like,&#8221; he said; &#8220;a million dollars?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers closed upon his shoulders. The eyes, still frightened, still
      searched his in appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then for my wedding-present,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;I want
      you to take that million dollars and send an expedition to the Amazon. And
      I will choose the men. Men unafraid; men not afraid of fever or sudden
      death; not afraid to tell the truth&#8211;even to <i>you</i>. And all the
      world will know. And they&#8211;I mean <i>you</i>&#8211;will set those
      people free!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he
      concealed under a manner of just indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My mind is made up,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;Existing conditions
      cannot continue. And to that end, at my own expense, I am sending an
      expedition across South America. It will investigate, punish, and
      establish reforms. I suggest, on account of this damned heat, we do now
      adjourn.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, over on Long Island, Carroll told his wife all, or nearly all.
      He did not tell her about the automatic pistol. And together on tiptoe
      they crept to the nursery and looked down at their sleeping children. When
      she rose from her knees the mother said, &#8220;But how can I thank him?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      By &#8220;him&#8221; she meant the Young Man of Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You never can thank him,&#8221; said Carroll; &#8220;that&#8217;s
      the worst of it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a long silence the mother said: &#8220;I will send him a
      photograph of the children. Do you think he will understand?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Down at Seabright, Hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden. The
      moon was so bright that the roses still held their color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I would like to thank him,&#8221; said the young wife. She meant
      the Young Man of Wall Street. &#8220;But for him we would have lost <i>this</i>.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes caressed the garden, the fruit-trees, the house with wide,
      hospitable verandas. &#8220;To-morrow I will send him some of these roses,&#8221;
      said the young wife. &#8220;Will he understand that they mean our home?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a scandalously late hour, in a scandalous spirit of independence, Champ
      Thorne and Barbara were driving around Central Park in a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How strangely the Lord moves, his wonders to perform,&#8221;
      misquoted Barbara. &#8220;Had not the Young Man of Wall Street saved Mr.
      Hastings, Mr. Hastings could not have raised your salary; you would not
      have asked me to marry you, and had you not asked me to marry you, father
      would not have given me a wedding-present, and&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And,&#8221; said Champ, taking up the tale, &#8220;thousands of
      slaves would still be buried in the jungles, hidden away from their wives
      and children, and the light of the sun and their fellow men. They still
      would be dying of fever, starvation, tortures.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand in both of his and held her finger-tips against his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And they will never know,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;when their
      freedom comes, that they owe it all to <i>you</i>.&#8221;

      On Hunter&#8217;s Island Jimmie Reeder and his bunkie, Sam Sturges, each
      on his canvas cot, tossed and twisted. The heat, the moonlight, and the
      mosquitoes would not let them even think of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That was bully,&#8221; said Jimmie, &#8220;what you did to-day
      about saving that dog. If it hadn&#8217;t been for you he&#8217;d ha&#8217;
      drownded.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He would <i>not</i>!&#8221; said Sammy with punctilious regard for
      the truth; &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t deep enough.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, the scout-master ought to know,&#8221; argued Jimmie; &#8220;he
      said it was the best &#8216;one good turn&#8217; of the day!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Modestly Sam shifted the limelight so that it fell upon his bunkie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; he declared loyally, &#8220;<i>your</i>
      &#8216;one good turn&#8217; was a better one!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie yawned, and then laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Me,&#8221; he scoffed, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do nothing. I sent my
      sister to the movies.&#8221;

    <h2>
      <a id="link_2"></a>THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before he finally arrested him, &#8220;Jimmie&#8221; Sniffen had seen the
      man with the golf-cap, and the blue eyes that laughed at you, three times.
      Twice, unexpectedly, he had come upon him in a wood road and once on Round
      Hill where the stranger was pretending to watch the sunset. Jimmie knew
      people do not climb hills merely to look at sunsets, so he was not
      deceived. He guessed the man was a German spy seeking gun sites, and
      secretly vowed to &#8220;stalk&#8221; him. From that moment, had the
      stranger known it, he was as good as dead. For a boy scout with badges on
      his sleeve for &#8220;stalking&#8221; and &#8220;path-finding,&#8221; not
      to boast of others for &#8220;gardening&#8221; and &#8220;cooking,&#8221;
      can outwit any spy. Even had General Baden-Powell remained in Mafeking and
      not invented the boy scout, Jimmie Sniffen would have been one. Because by
      birth he was a boy, and by inheritance a scout. In Westchester County the
      Sniffens are one of the county families. If it isn&#8217;t a Sarles, it&#8217;s
      a Sniffen; and with Brundages, Platts, and Jays, the Sniffens date back to
      when the acres of the first Charles Ferris ran from the Boston post road
      to the coach road to Albany, and when the first Gouverneur Morris stood on
      one of his hills and saw the Indian canoes in the Hudson and in the Sound
      and rejoiced that all the land between belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not believe in heredity, the fact that Jimmie&#8217;s
      great-great-grandfather was a scout for General Washington and hunted
      deer, and even bear, over exactly the same hills where Jimmie hunted
      weasels will count for nothing. It will not explain why to Jimmie, from
      Tarrytown to Port Chester, the hills, the roads, the woods, and the
      cowpaths, caves, streams, and springs hidden in the woods were as familiar
      as his own kitchen garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor explain why, when you could not see a Pease and Elliman &#8220;For
      Sale&#8221; sign nailed to a tree, Jimmie could see in the highest
      branches a last year&#8217;s bird&#8217;s nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or why, when he was out alone playing Indians and had sunk his scout&#8217;s
      axe into a fallen log and then scalped the log, he felt that once before
      in those same woods he had trailed that same Indian, and with his own
      tomahawk split open his skull. Sometimes when he knelt to drink at a
      secret spring in the forest, the autumn leaves would crackle and he would
      raise his eyes fearing to see a panther facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But there ain&#8217;t no panthers in Westchester,&#8221; Jimmie
      would reassure himself. And in the distance the roar of an automobile
      climbing a hill with the muffler open would seem to suggest he was right.
      But still Jimmie remembered once before he had knelt at that same spring,
      and that when he raised his eyes he had faced a crouching panther. &#8220;Mebbe
      dad told me it happened to grandpop,&#8221; Jimmie would explain, &#8220;or
      I dreamed it, or, mebbe, I read it in a story book.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &#8220;German spy&#8221; mania attacked Round Hill after the visit to
      the boy scouts of Clavering Gould, the war correspondent. He was spending
      the week-end with &#8220;Squire&#8221; Harry Van Vorst, and as young Van
      Vorst, besides being a justice of the peace and a Master of Beagles and
      President of the Country Club, was also a local &#8220;councilman&#8221;
      for the Round Hill Scouts, he brought his guest to a camp-fire meeting to
      talk to them. In deference to his audience, Gould told them of the boy
      scouts he had seen in Belgium and of the part they were playing in the
      great war. It was his peroration that made trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And any day,&#8221; he assured his audience, &#8220;this country
      may be at war with Germany; and every one of you boys will be expected to
      do his bit. You can begin now. When the Germans land it will be near New
      Haven, or New Bedford. They will first capture the munition works at
      Springfield, Hartford, and Watervliet so as to make sure of their
      ammunition, and then they will start for New York City. They will follow
      the New Haven and New York Central railroads, and march straight through
      this village. I haven&#8217;t the least doubt,&#8221; exclaimed the
      enthusiastic war prophet, &#8220;that at this moment German spies are as
      thick in Westchester as blackberries. They are here to select camp sites
      and gun positions, to find out which of these hills enfilade the others
      and to learn to what extent their armies can live on the country. They are
      counting the cows, the horses, the barns where fodder is stored; and they
      are marking down on their maps the wells and streams.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      As though at that moment a German spy might be crouching behind the door,
      Mr. Gould spoke in a whisper. &#8220;Keep your eyes open!&#8221; he
      commanded. &#8220;Watch every stranger. If he acts suspiciously, get word
      quick to your sheriff, or to Judge Van Vorst here. Remember the scouts&#8217;
      motto, &#8216;Be prepared!&#8217;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night as the scouts walked home, behind each wall and hayrick they
      saw spiked helmets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Van Vorst was extremely annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Next time you talk to my scouts,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
      talk on &#8216;Votes for Women.&#8217; After what you said to-night every
      real-estate agent who dares open a map will be arrested. We&#8217;re not
      trying to drive people away from Westchester, we&#8217;re trying to sell
      them building sites.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;<i>You</i> are not!&#8221; retorted his friend, &#8220;you own half
      the county now, and you&#8217;re trying to buy the other half.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m a justice of the peace,&#8221; explained Van Vorst.
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know <i>why</i> I am, except that they wished it on
      me. All I get out of it is trouble. The Italians make charges against my
      best friends for over-speeding, and I have to fine them, and my best
      friends bring charges against the Italians for poaching, and when I fine
      the Italians they send me Black Hand letters. And now every day I&#8217;ll
      be asked to issue a warrant for a German spy who is selecting gun sites.
      And he will turn out to be a millionaire who is tired of living at the
      Ritz-Carlton and wants to &#8216;own his own home&#8217; and his own
      golf-links. And he&#8217;ll be so hot at being arrested that he&#8217;ll
      take his millions to Long Island and try to break into the Piping Rock
      Club. And it will be your fault!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young justice of the peace was right. At least so far as Jimmie
      Sniffen was concerned, the words of the war prophet had filled one mind
      with unrest. In the past Jimmie&#8217;s idea of a holiday had been to
      spend it scouting in the woods. In this pleasure he was selfish. He did
      not want companions who talked, and trampled upon the dead leaves so that
      they frightened the wild animals and gave the Indians warning. Jimmie
      liked to pretend. He liked to fill the woods with wary and hostile
      adversaries. It was a game of his own inventing. If he crept to the top of
      a hill and, on peering over it, surprised a fat woodchuck, he pretended
      the woodchuck was a bear, weighing two hundred pounds; if, himself
      unobserved, he could lie and watch, off its guard, a rabbit, squirrel, or,
      most difficult of all, a crow, it became a deer and that night at supper
      Jimmie made believe he was eating venison. Sometimes he was a scout of the
      Continental Army and carried despatches to General Washington. The rules
      of that game were that if any man ploughing in the fields, or cutting
      trees in the woods, or even approaching along the same road, saw Jimmie
      before Jimmie saw him, Jimmie was taken prisoner, and before sunrise was
      shot as a spy. He was seldom shot. Or else why on his sleeve was the badge
      for &#8220;stalking&#8221;? But always to have to make believe became
      monotonous. Even &#8220;dry shopping&#8221; along the Rue de la Paix, when
      you pretend you can have anything you see in any window, leaves one just
      as rich, but unsatisfied. So the advice of the war correspondent to seek
      out German spies came to Jimmie like a day at the circus, like a week at
      the Danbury Fair. It not only was a call to arms, to protect his flag and
      home, but a chance to play in earnest the game in which he most delighted.
      No longer need he pretend. No longer need he waste his energies in
      watching, unobserved, a greedy rabbit rob a carrot field. The game now was
      his fellow-man and his enemy; not only his enemy, but the enemy of his
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first effort Jimmie was not entirely successful. The man looked the
      part perfectly; he wore an auburn beard, disguising spectacles, and he
      carried a suspicious knapsack. But he turned out to be a professor from
      the Museum of Natural History, who wanted to dig for Indian arrow-heads.
      And when Jimmie threatened to arrest him, the indignant gentleman arrested
      Jimmie. Jimmie escaped only by leading the professor to a secret cave of
      his own, though on some one else&#8217;s property, where one not only
      could dig for arrow-heads, but find them. The professor was delighted, but
      for Jimmie it was a great disappointment. The week following Jimmie was
      again disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bank of the Kensico Reservoir, he came upon a man who was acting in
      a mysterious and suspicious manner. He was making notes in a book, and his
      runabout which he had concealed in a wood road was stuffed with
      blue-prints. It did not take Jimmie long to guess his purpose. He was
      planning to blow up the Kensico dam, and cut off the water supply of New
      York City. Seven millions of people without water! Without firing a shot,
      New York must surrender! At the thought Jimmie shuddered, and at the risk
      of his life, by clinging to the tail of a motor truck, he followed the
      runabout into White Plains. But there it developed the mysterious
      stranger, so far from wishing to destroy the Kensico dam, was the State
      Engineer who had built it, and, also, a large part of the Panama Canal.
      Nor in his third effort was Jimmie more successful. From the heights of
      Pound Ridge he discovered on a hilltop below him a man working along upon
      a basin of concrete. The man was a German-American, and already on Jimmie&#8217;s
      list of &#8220;suspects.&#8221; That for the use of the German artillery
      he was preparing a concrete bed for a siege gun was only too evident. But
      closer investigation proved that the concrete was only two inches thick.
      And the hyphenated one explained that the basin was built over a spring,
      in the waters of which he planned to erect a fountain and raise goldfish.
      It was a bitter blow. Jimmie became discouraged. Meeting Judge Van Vorst
      one day in the road he told him his troubles. The young judge proved
      unsympathetic. &#8220;My advice to you, Jimmie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is
      to go slow. Accusing everybody of espionage is a very serious matter. If
      you call a man a spy, it&#8217;s sometimes hard for him to disprove it;
      and the name sticks. So, go slow&#8211;very slow. Before you arrest any
      more people, come to me first for a warrant.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the next time Jimmie proceeded with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides being a farmer in a small way, Jimmie&#8217;s father was a handy
      man with tools. He had no union card, but, in laying shingles along a blue
      chalk line, few were as expert. It was August, there was no school, and
      Jimmie was carrying a dinner-pail to where his father was at work on a new
      barn. He made a cross-cut through the woods, and came upon the young man
      in the golf-cap. The stranger nodded, and his eyes, which seemed to be
      always laughing, smiled pleasantly. But he was deeply tanned, and, from
      the waist up, held himself like a soldier, so, at once, Jimmie mistrusted
      him. Early the next morning Jimmie met him again. It had not been raining,
      but the clothes of the young man were damp. Jimmie guessed that while the
      dew was still on the leaves the young man had been forcing his way through
      underbrush. The stranger must have remembered Jimmie, for he laughed and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, my friend with the dinner-pail! It&#8217;s luck you haven&#8217;t
      got it now, or I&#8217;d hold you up. I&#8217;m starving!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie smiled in sympathy. &#8220;It&#8217;s early to be hungry,&#8221;
      said Jimmie; &#8220;when did you have your breakfast?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; laughed the young man. &#8220;I went out to
      walk up an appetite, and I lost myself. But I haven&#8217;t lost my
      appetite. Which is the shortest way back to Bedford?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The first road to your right,&#8221; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is it far?&#8221; asked the stranger anxiously. That he was very
      hungry was evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a half-hour&#8217;s walk,&#8221; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If I live that long,&#8221; corrected the young man; and stepped
      out briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie knew that within a hundred yards a turn in the road would shut him
      from sight. So, he gave the stranger time to walk that distance, and then,
      diving into the wood that lined the road, &#8220;stalked&#8221; him. From
      behind a tree he saw the stranger turn and look back, and seeing no one in
      the road behind him, also leave it and plunge into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not turned toward Bedford; he had turned to the left. Like a runner
      stealing bases, Jimmie slipped from tree to tree. Ahead of him he heard
      the stranger trampling upon dead twigs, moving rapidly as one who knew his
      way. At times through the branches Jimmie could see the broad shoulders of
      the stranger, and again could follow his progress only by the noise of the
      crackling twigs. When the noises ceased, Jimmie guessed the stranger had
      reached the wood road, grass-grown and moss-covered, that led to Middle
      Patent. So, he ran at right angles until he also reached it, and as now he
      was close to where it entered the main road, he approached warily. But he
      was too late. There was a sound like the whir of a rising partridge, and
      ahead of him from where it had been hidden, a gray touring-car leaped into
      the highway. The stranger was at the wheel. Throwing behind it a cloud of
      dust, the car raced toward Greenwich. Jimmie had time to note only that it
      bore a Connecticut State license; that in the wheel-ruts the tires printed
      little V&#8217;s, like arrow-heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week Jimmie saw nothing of the spy, but for many hot and dusty miles
      he stalked arrow-heads. They lured him north, they lured him south, they
      were stamped in soft asphalt, in mud, dust, and fresh-spread tarvia.
      Wherever Jimmie walked, arrow-heads ran before. In his sleep as in his
      copy-book, he saw endless chains of V&#8217;s. But not once could he catch
      up with the wheels that printed them. A week later, just at sunset as he
      passed below Round Hill, he saw the stranger on top of it. On the skyline,
      in silhouette against the sinking sun, he was as conspicuous as a
      flagstaff. But to approach him was impossible. For acres Round Hill
      offered no other cover than stubble. It was as bald as a skull. Until the
      stranger chose to descend, Jimmie must wait. And the stranger was in no
      haste. The sun sank and from the west Jimmie saw him turn his face east
      toward the Sound. A storm was gathering, drops of rain began to splash and
      as the sky grew black the figure on the hilltop faded into the darkness.
      And then, at the very spot where Jimmie had last seen it, there suddenly
      flared two tiny flashes of fire. Jimmie leaped from cover. It was no
      longer to be endured. The spy was signalling. The time for caution had
      passed, now was the time to act. Jimmie raced to the top of the hill, and
      found it empty. He plunged down it, vaulted a stone wall, forced his way
      through a tangle of saplings, and held his breath to listen. Just beyond
      him, over a jumble of rocks, a hidden stream was tripping and tumbling.
      Joyfully it laughed and gurgled. Jimmie turned hot. It sounded as though
      from the darkness the spy mocked him. Jimmie shook his fist at the
      enshrouding darkness. Above the tumult of the coming storm and the tossing
      tree-tops, he raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You wait!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you yet! Next
      time, I&#8217;ll bring a gun.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time was the next morning. There had been a hawk hovering over the
      chicken yard, and Jimmie used that fact to explain his borrowing the
      family shotgun. He loaded it with buckshot, and, in the pocket of his
      shirt buttoned his license to &#8220;hunt, pursue and kill, to take with
      traps or other devices.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that Judge Van Vorst had warned him, before he arrested more
      spies, to come to him for a warrant. But with an impatient shake of the
      head Jimmie tossed the recollection from him. After what he had seen he
      could not possibly be again mistaken. He did not need a warrant. What he
      had seen was his warrant&#8211;plus the shotgun.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a &#8220;pathfinder&#8221; should, he planned to take up the trail
      where he had lost it, but, before he reached Round Hill, he found a warmer
      trail. Before him, stamped clearly in the road still damp from the rain of
      the night before, two lines of little arrow-heads pointed the way. They
      were so fresh that at each twist in the road, lest the car should be just
      beyond him, Jimmie slackened his steps. After half a mile the scent grew
      hot. The tracks were deeper, the arrow-heads more clearly cut, and Jimmie
      broke into a run. Then, the arrow-heads swung suddenly to the right, and
      in a clearing at the edge of a wood, were lost. But the tires had pressed
      deep into the grass, and just inside the wood, he found the car. It was
      empty. Jimmie was drawn two ways. Should he seek the spy on the nearest
      hilltop, or, until the owner returned, wait by the car? Between lying in
      ambush and action, Jimmie preferred action. But, he did not climb the hill
      nearest the car; he climbed the hill that overlooked that hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flat on the ground, hidden in the goldenrod, he lay motionless. Before
      him, for fifteen miles stretched hills and tiny valleys. Six miles away to
      his right rose the stone steeple, and the red roofs of Greenwich. Directly
      before him were no signs of habitation, only green forests, green fields,
      gray stone walls, and, where a road ran up-hill, a splash of white, that
      quivered in the heat. The storm of the night before had washed the air.
      Each leaf stood by itself. Nothing stirred; and in the glare of the August
      sun every detail of the landscape was as distinct as those in a colored
      photograph; and as still.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement the scout was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If he moves,&#8221; he sighed happily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got him!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite, across a little valley was the hill at the base of which he had
      found the car. The slope toward him was bare, but the top was crowned with
      a thick wood; and along its crest, as though establishing an ancient
      boundary, ran a stone wall, moss-covered and wrapped in poison-ivy. In
      places, the branches of the trees, reaching out to the sun, overhung the
      wall and hid it in black shadows. Jimmie divided the hill into sectors. He
      began at the right, and slowly followed the wall. With his eyes he took it
      apart, stone by stone. Had a chipmunk raised his head, Jimmie would have
      seen him. So, when from the stone wall, like the reflection of the sun
      upon a window-pane, something flashed, Jimmie knew he had found his spy. A
      pair of binoculars had betrayed him. Jimmie now saw him clearly. He sat on
      the ground at the top of the hill opposite, in the deep shadow of an oak,
      his back against the stone wall. With the binoculars to his eyes he had
      leaned too far forward, and upon the glass the sun had flashed a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie appreciated that his attack must be made from the rear. Backward,
      like a crab he wriggled free of the goldenrod, and hidden by the contour
      of the hill, raced down it and into the woods on the hill opposite. When
      he came to within twenty feet of the oak beneath which he had seen the
      stranger, he stood erect, and as though avoiding a live wire, stepped on
      tiptoe to the wall. The stranger still sat against it. The binoculars hung
      from a cord around his neck. Across his knees was spread a map. He was
      marking it with a pencil, and as he worked he hummed a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie knelt, and resting the gun on the top of the wall, covered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Throw up your hands!&#8221; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger did not start. Except that he raised his eyes he gave no sign
      that he had heard. His eyes stared across the little sun-filled valley.
      They were half closed as though in study, as though perplexed by some deep
      and intricate problem. They appeared to see beyond the sun-filled valley
      some place of greater moment, some place far distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the eyes smiled, and slowly, as though his neck were stiff, but still
      smiling, the stranger turned his head. When he saw the boy, his smile was
      swept away in waves of surprise, amazement, and disbelief. These were
      followed instantly by an expression of the most acute alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t point that thing at me!&#8221; shouted the stranger.
      &#8220;Is it loaded?&#8221; With his cheek pressed to the stock and his
      eye squinted down the length of the brown barrel, Jimmie nodded. The
      stranger flung up his open palms. They accented his expression of amazed
      incredulity. He seemed to be exclaiming, &#8220;Can such things be?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Get up!&#8221; commanded Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      With alacrity the stranger rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Walk over there,&#8221; ordered the scout. &#8220;Walk backward.
      Stop! Take off those field-glasses and throw them to me.&#8221; Without
      removing his eyes from the gun the stranger lifted the binoculars from his
      neck and tossed them to the stone wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;See here!&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll only point that
      damned blunderbuss the other way, you can have the glasses, and my watch,
      and clothes, and all my money; only don&#8217;t&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie flushed crimson. &#8220;You can&#8217;t bribe me,&#8221; he
      growled. At least, he tried to growl, but because his voice was changing,
      or because he was excited the growl ended in a high squeak. With
      mortification, Jimmie flushed a deeper crimson. But the stranger was not
      amused. At Jimmie&#8217;s words he seemed rather the more amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to bribe you,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;If
      you don&#8217;t want anything, why are you holding me up?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; returned Jimmie, &#8220;I&#8217;m arresting
      you!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger laughed with relief. Again his eyes smiled. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
      he cried, &#8220;I see! Have I been trespassing?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glance Jimmie measured the distance between himself and the
      stranger. Reassured, he lifted one leg after the other over the wall.
      &#8220;If you try to rush me,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot
      you full of buckshot.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger took a hasty step <i>backward</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
      not rush you. Why am I arrested?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugging the shotgun with his left arm, Jimmie stopped and lifted the
      binoculars. He gave them a swift glance, slung them over his shoulder, and
      again clutched his weapon. His expression was now stern and menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The name on them,&#8221; he accused, &#8220;is &#8216;Weiss,
      Berlin.&#8217; Is that your name?&#8221; The stranger smiled, but
      corrected himself, and replied gravely, &#8220;That&#8217;s the name of
      the firm that makes them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie exclaimed in triumph. &#8220;Hah!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;made in
      Germany!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where <i>would</i>
      a Weiss glass be made?&#8221; With polite insistence he repeated, &#8220;Would
      you mind telling me why I am arrested, and who <i>you</i> might happen to
      be?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie did not answer. Again he stooped and picked up the map, and as he
      did so, for the first time the face of the stranger showed that he was
      annoyed. Jimmie was not at home with maps. They told him nothing. But the
      penciled notes on this one made easy reading. At his first glance he saw,
      &#8220;Correct range, 1,800 yards&#8221;; &#8220;this stream not fordable&#8221;;
      &#8220;slope of hill 15 degrees inaccessible for artillery.&#8221; &#8220;Wire
      entanglements here&#8221;; &#8220;forage for five squadrons.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie&#8217;s eyes flashed. He shoved the map inside his shirt, and with
      the gun motioned toward the base of the hill. &#8220;Keep forty feet ahead
      of me,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and walk to your car.&#8221; The
      stranger did not seem to hear him. He spoke with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to explain to you
      about that map.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not to me, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; declared his captor. &#8220;You&#8217;re
      going to drive straight to Judge Van Vorst&#8217;s, and explain to <i>him</i>!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger tossed his arms even higher. &#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he
      exclaimed gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his prisoner Jimmie encountered no further trouble. He made a willing
      captive. And if in covering the five miles to Judge Van Vorst&#8217;s he
      exceeded the speed limit, the fact that from the rear seat Jimmie held the
      shotgun against the base of his skull was an extenuating circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived in the nick of time. In his own car young Van Vorst and a bag
      of golf clubs were just drawing away from the house. Seeing the car
      climbing the steep driveway that for a half-mile led from his lodge to his
      front door, and seeing Jimmie standing in the tonneau brandishing a gun,
      the Judge hastily descended. The sight of the spy hunter filled him with
      misgiving, but the sight of him gave Jimmie sweet relief. Arresting German
      spies for a small boy is no easy task. For Jimmie the strain was great.
      And now that he knew he had successfully delivered him into the hands of
      the law, Jimmie&#8217;s heart rose with happiness. The added presence of a
      butler of magnificent bearing and of an athletic looking chauffeur
      increased his sense of security. Their presence seemed to afford a feeling
      of security to the prisoner also. As he brought the car to a halt, he
      breathed a sigh. It was a sigh of deep relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie fell from the tonneau. In concealing his sense of triumph, he was
      not entirely successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I got him!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t make no mistake
      about <i>this</i> one!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What one?&#8221; demanded Van Vorst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie pointed dramatically at his prisoner. With an anxious expression
      the stranger was tenderly fingering the back of his head. He seemed to
      wish to assure himself that it was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;<i>That</i> one!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;He&#8217;s a German
      spy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The patience of Judge Van Vorst fell from him. In his exclamation was
      indignation, anger, reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jimmie!&#8221; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie thrust into his hand the map. It was his &#8220;Exhibit A.&#8221;
      &#8220;Look what he&#8217;s wrote,&#8221; commanded the scout. &#8220;It&#8217;s
      all military words. And these are his glasses. I took &#8217;em off him.
      They&#8217;re made in <i>Germany</i>! I been stalking him for a week. He&#8217;s
      a spy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmie thrust the map before his face, Van Vorst had glanced at it.
      Then he regarded it more closely. As he raised his eyes they showed that
      he was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he greeted the prisoner politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely sorry you&#8217;ve been annoyed,&#8221; he
      said. &#8220;I&#8217;m only glad it&#8217;s no worse. He might have shot
      you. He&#8217;s mad over the idea that every stranger he sees&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner quickly interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Please!&#8221; he begged, &#8220;don&#8217;t blame the boy. He
      behaved extremely well. Might I speak with you&#8211;<i>alone</i>?&#8221;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Van Vorst led the way across the terrace, and to the smoking-room,
      that served also as his office, and closed the door. The stranger walked
      directly to the mantelpiece and put his finger on a gold cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I saw your mare win that at Belmont Park,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She
      must have been a great loss to you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She was,&#8221; said Van Vorst. &#8220;The week before she broke
      her back, I refused three thousand for her. Will you have a cigarette?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger waved aside the cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I brought you inside,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because I didn&#8217;t
      want your servants to hear; and because I don&#8217;t want to hurt that
      boy&#8217;s feelings. He&#8217;s a fine boy; and he&#8217;s a damned
      clever scout. I knew he was following me and I threw him off twice, but
      to-day he caught me fair. If I really had been a German spy, I couldn&#8217;t
      have got away from him. And I want him to think he <i>has</i> captured a
      German spy. Because he deserves just as much credit as though he had, and
      because it&#8217;s best he shouldn&#8217;t know whom he <i>did</i>
      capture.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Vorst pointed to the map. &#8220;My bet is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
      you&#8217;re an officer of the State militia, taking notes for the fall
      man&oelig;uvres. Am I right?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled in approval, but shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;re warm,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s more
      serious than man&oelig;uvres. It&#8217;s the Real Thing.&#8221; From his
      pocketbook he took a visiting card and laid it on the table. &#8220;I&#8217;m
      &#8216;Sherry&#8217; McCoy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Captain of Artillery in
      the United States Army.&#8221; He nodded to the hand telephone on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You can call up Governor&#8217;s Island and get General Wood or his
      aide, Captain Dorey, on the phone. They sent me here. Ask <i>them</i>. I&#8217;m
      not picking out gun sites for the Germans; I&#8217;m picking out positions
      of defense for Americans when the Germans come!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Vorst laughed derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My word!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You&#8217;re as bad as Jimmie!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain McCoy regarded him with disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And you, sir,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;are as bad as ninety
      million other Americans. You <i>won&#8217;t</i> believe! When the Germans
      are shelling this hill, when they&#8217;re taking your hunters to pull
      their cook-wagons, maybe, you&#8217;ll believe <i>then</i>.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are you serious?&#8221; demanded Van Vorst. &#8220;And you an army
      officer?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s why I am serious,&#8221; returned McCoy. &#8220;<i>We</i>
      know. But when we try to prepare for what is coming, we must do it
      secretly&#8211;in underhand ways, for fear the newspapers will get hold of
      it and ridicule us, and accuse us of trying to drag the country into war.
      That&#8217;s why we have to prepare under cover. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve
      had to skulk around these hills like a chicken thief. And,&#8221; he added
      sharply, &#8220;that&#8217;s why that boy must not know who I am. If he
      does, the General Staff will get a calling down at Washington, and I&#8217;ll
      have my ears boxed.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Vorst moved to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He will never learn the truth from me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For I
      will tell him you are to be shot at sunrise.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Good!&#8221; laughed the Captain. &#8220;And tell me his name. If
      ever we fight over Westchester County, I want that lad for my chief of
      scouts. And give him this. Tell him to buy a new scout uniform. Tell him
      it comes from you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no money could reconcile Jimmie to the sentence imposed upon his
      captive. He received the news with a howl of anguish. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t,&#8221;
      he begged; &#8220;I never knowed you&#8217;d <i>shoot</i> him! I wouldn&#8217;t
      have caught him if I&#8217;d knowed that. I couldn&#8217;t sleep if I
      thought he was going to be shot at sunrise.&#8221; At the prospect of
      unending nightmares Jimmie&#8217;s voice shook with terror. &#8220;Make it
      for twenty years,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;Make it for ten,&#8221; he
      coaxed, &#8220;but, <i>please</i>, promise you won&#8217;t shoot him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Van Vorst returned to Captain McCoy, he was smiling, and the butler
      who followed, bearing a tray and tinkling glasses, was trying not to
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I gave Jimmie your ten dollars,&#8221; said Van Vorst, &#8220;and
      made it twenty, and he has gone home. You will be glad to hear that he
      begged me to spare your life, and that your sentence has been commuted to
      twenty years in a fortress. I drink to your good fortune.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No!&#8221; protested Captain McCoy, &#8220;we will drink to Jimmie!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain McCoy had driven away, and his own car and the golf clubs had
      again been brought to the steps, Judge Van Vorst once more attempted to
      depart; but he was again delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other visitors were arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the driveway a touring-car approached, and though it limped on a flat
      tire, it approached at reckless speed. The two men in the front seat were
      white with dust; their faces, masked by automobile glasses, were
      indistinguishable. As though preparing for an immediate exit, the car
      swung in a circle until its nose pointed down the driveway up which it had
      just come. Raising his silk mask the one beside the driver shouted at
      Judge Van Vorst. His throat was parched, his voice was hoarse and hot with
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A gray touring-car,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;It stopped here. We
      saw it from that hill. Then the damn tire burst, and we lost our way.
      Where did he go?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who?&#8221; demanded Van Vorst, stiffly, &#8220;Captain McCoy?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man exploded with an oath. The driver, with a shove of his elbow,
      silenced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Captain McCoy,&#8221; assented the driver eagerly. &#8220;Which
      way did he go?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To New York,&#8221; said Van Vorst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver shrieked at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then, he&#8217;s doubled back,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He&#8217;s
      gone to New Haven.&#8221; He stooped and threw in the clutch. The car
      lurched forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold terror swept young Van Vorst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What do you want with him?&#8221; he called. &#8220;Who <i>are</i>
      you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over one shoulder the masked face glared at him. Above the roar of the car
      the words of the driver were flung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;re Secret Service from Washington,&#8221; he shouted.
      &#8220;He&#8217;s from their embassy. He&#8217;s a German spy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaping and throbbing at sixty miles an hour, the car vanished in a
      curtain of white, whirling dust.
    </p>

      <a id="link_3"></a>GALLEGHER
    </h2>
    <p class="tac tiz fs12 mb20">
      A NEWSPAPER STORY
    </p>
    <p class="tiz">
      We had had so many office-boys before Gallegher came among us that they
      had begun to lose the characteristics of individuals, and became merged in
      a composite photograph of small boys, to whom we applied the generic title
      of &#8220;Here, you&#8221;; or &#8220;You, boy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      We had had sleepy boys, and lazy boys, and bright, &#8220;smart&#8221;
      boys, who became so familiar on so short an acquaintance that we were
      forced to part with them to save our own self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They generally graduated into district-messenger boys, and occasionally
      returned to us in blue coats with nickel-plated buttons, and patronized
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gallegher was something different from anything we had experienced
      before. Gallegher was short and broad in build, with a solid, muscular
      broadness, and not a fat and dumpy shortness. He wore perpetually on his
      face a happy and knowing smile, as if you and the world in general were
      not impressing him as seriously as you thought you were, and his eyes,
      which were very black and very bright, snapped intelligently at you like
      those of a little black-and-tan terrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Gallegher knew had been learnt on the streets; not a very good school
      in itself, but one that turns out very knowing scholars. And Gallegher had
      attended both morning and evening sessions. He could not tell you who the
      Pilgrim Fathers were, nor could he name the thirteen original States, but
      he knew all the officers of the twenty-second police district by name, and
      he could distinguish the clang of a fire-engine&#8217;s gong from that of
      a patrol-wagon or an ambulance fully two blocks distant. It was Gallegher
      who rang the alarm when the Woolwich Mills caught fire, while the officer
      on the beat was asleep, and it was Gallegher who led the &#8220;Black
      Diamonds&#8221; against the &#8220;Wharf Rats,&#8221; when they used to
      stone each other to their heart&#8217;s content on the coal-wharves of
      Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid, now that I see these facts written down, that Gallegher was
      not a reputable character; but he was so very young and so very old for
      his years that we all liked him very much nevertheless. He lived in the
      extreme northern part of Philadelphia, where the cotton and woollen mills
      run down to the river, and how he ever got home after leaving the <i>Press</i>
      building at two in the morning, was one of the mysteries of the office.
      Sometimes he caught a night car, and sometimes he walked all the way,
      arriving at the little house, where his mother and himself lived alone, at
      four in the morning. Occasionally he was given a ride on an early
      milk-cart, or on one of the newspaper delivery wagons, with its high piles
      of papers still damp and sticky from the press. He knew several drivers of
      &#8220;night hawks&#8221;&#8211;those cabs that prowl the streets at night
      looking for belated passengers&#8211;and when it was a very cold morning
      he would not go home at all, but would crawl into one of these cabs and
      sleep, curled up on the cushions, until daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides being quick and cheerful, Gallegher possessed a power of amusing
      the <i>Press&#8217;s</i> young men to a degree seldom attained by the
      ordinary mortal. His clog-dancing on the city editor&#8217;s desk, when
      that gentleman was up-stairs fighting for two more columns of space, was
      always a source of innocent joy to us, and his imitations of the comedians
      of the variety halls delighted even the dramatic critic, from whom the
      comedians themselves failed to force a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gallegher&#8217;s chief characteristic was his love for that element
      of news generically classed as &#8220;crime.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he ever did anything criminal himself. On the contrary, his was
      rather the work of the criminal specialist, and his morbid interest in the
      doings of all queer characters, his knowledge of their methods, their
      present whereabouts, and their past deeds of transgression often rendered
      him a valuable ally to our police reporter, whose daily feuilletons were
      the only portion of the paper Gallegher deigned to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gallegher the detective element was abnormally developed. He had shown
      this on several occasions, and to excellent purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the paper had sent him into a Home for Destitute Orphans which was
      believed to be grievously mismanaged, and Gallegher, while playing the
      part of a destitute orphan, kept his eyes open to what was going on around
      him so faithfully that the story he told of the treatment meted out to the
      real orphans was sufficient to rescue the unhappy little wretches from the
      individual who had them in charge, and to have the individual himself sent
      to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher&#8217;s knowledge of the aliases, terms of imprisonment, and
      various misdoings of the leading criminals in Philadelphia was almost as
      thorough as that of the chief of police himself, and he could tell to an
      hour when &#8220;Dutchy Mack&#8221; was to be let out of prison, and could
      identify at a glance &#8220;Dick Oxford, confidence man,&#8221; as &#8220;Gentleman
      Dan, petty thief.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, at this time, only two pieces of news in any of the papers.
      The least important of the two was the big fight between the Champion of
      the United States and the Would-be Champion, arranged to take place near
      Philadelphia; the second was the Burrbank murder, which was filling space
      in newspapers all over the world, from New York to Bombay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard F. Burrbank was one of the most prominent of New York&#8217;s
      railroad lawyers; he was also, as a matter of course, an owner of much
      railroad stock, and a very wealthy man. He had been spoken of as a
      political possibility for many high offices, and, as the counsel for a
      great railroad, was known even further than the great railroad itself had
      stretched its system.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&#8217;clock one morning he was found by his butler lying at the
      foot of the hall stairs with two pistol wounds above his heart. He was
      quite dead. His safe, to which only he and his secretary had the keys, was
      found open, and $200,000 in bonds, stocks, and money, which had been
      placed there only the night before, was found missing. The secretary was
      missing also. His name was Stephen S. Hade, and his name and his
      description had been telegraphed and cabled to all parts of the world.
      There was enough circumstantial evidence to show, beyond any question or
      possibility of mistake, that he was the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made an enormous amount of talk, and unhappy individuals were being
      arrested all over the country, and sent on to New York for identification.
      Three had been arrested at Liverpool, and one man just as he landed at
      Sydney, Australia. But so far the murderer had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all talking about it one night, as everybody else was all over the
      country, in the local room, and the city editor said it was worth a
      fortune to any one who chanced to run across Hade and succeeded in handing
      him over to the police. Some of us thought Hade had taken passage from
      some one of the smaller seaports, and others were of the opinion that he
      had buried himself in some cheap lodging-house in New York, or in one of
      the smaller towns in New Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to meet him out walking, right here
      in Philadelphia,&#8221; said one of the staff. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be
      disguised, of course, but you could always tell him by the absence of the
      trigger finger on his right hand. It&#8217;s missing, you know; shot off
      when he was a boy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You want to look for a man dressed like a tough,&#8221; said the
      city editor; &#8220;for as this fellow is to all appearances a gentleman,
      he will try to look as little like a gentleman as possible.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, he won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gallegher, with that calm
      impertinence that made him dear to us. &#8220;He&#8217;ll dress just like
      a gentleman. Toughs don&#8217;t wear gloves, and you see he&#8217;s got to
      wear &#8217;em. The first thing he thought of after doing for Burrbank was
      of that gone finger, and how he was to hide it. He stuffed the finger of
      that glove with cotton so&#8217;s to make it look like a whole finger, and
      the first time he takes off that glove they&#8217;ve got him&#8211;see,
      and he knows it. So what youse want to do is to look for a man with gloves
      on. I&#8217;ve been a-doing it for two weeks now, and I can tell you it&#8217;s
      hard work, for everybody wears gloves this kind of weather. But if you
      look long enough you&#8217;ll find him. And when you think it&#8217;s him,
      go up to him and hold out your hand in a friendly way, like a
      bunco-steerer, and shake his hand; and if you feel that his forefinger ain&#8217;t
      real flesh, but just wadded cotton, then grip to it with your right and
      grab his throat with your left, and holler for help.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an appreciative pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I see, gentlemen,&#8221; said the city editor, dryly, &#8220;that
      Gallegher&#8217;s reasoning has impressed you; and I also see that before
      the week is out all of my young men will be under bonds for assaulting
      innocent pedestrians whose only offense is that they wear gloves in
      midwinter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      It was about a week after this that Detective Hefflefinger, of Inspector
      Byrnes&#8217;s staff, came over to Philadelphia after a burglar, of whose
      whereabouts he had been misinformed by telegraph. He brought the warrant,
      requisition, and other necessary papers with him, but the burglar had
      flown. One of our reporters had worked on a New York paper, and knew
      Hefflefinger, and the detective came to the office to see if he could help
      him in his so far unsuccessful search.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Gallegher his card, and after Gallegher had read it, and had
      discovered who the visitor was, he became so demoralized that he was
      absolutely useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;One of Byrnes&#8217;s men&#8221; was a much more awe-inspiring
      individual to Gallegher than a member of the Cabinet. He accordingly
      seized his hat and overcoat, and leaving his duties to be looked after by
      others, hastened out after the object of his admiration, who found his
      suggestions and knowledge of the city so valuable, and his company so
      entertaining, that they became very intimate, and spent the rest of the
      day together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the managing editor had instructed his subordinates to
      inform Gallegher, when he condescended to return, that his services were
      no longer needed. Gallegher had played truant once too often. Unconscious
      of this, he remained with his new friend until late the same evening, and
      started the next afternoon toward the <i>Press</i> office.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      As I have said, Gallegher lived in the most distant part of the city, not
      many minutes&#8217; walk from the Kensington railroad station, where
      trains ran into the suburbs and on to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in front of this station that a smoothly shaven, well-dressed man
      brushed past Gallegher and hurried up the steps to the ticket office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held a walking-stick in his right hand, and Gallegher, who now
      patiently scrutinized the hands of every one who wore gloves, saw that
      while three fingers of the man&#8217;s hand were closed around the cane,
      the fourth stood out in almost a straight line with his palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher stopped with a gasp and with a trembling all over his little
      body, and his brain asked with a throb if it could be possible. But
      possibilities and probabilities were to be discovered later. Now was the
      time for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was after the man in a moment, hanging at his heels and his eyes moist
      with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the man ask for a ticket to Torresdale, a little station just
      outside of Philadelphia, and when he was out of hearing, but not out of
      sight, purchased one for the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger went into the smoking-car, and seated himself at one end
      toward the door. Gallegher took his place at the opposite end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling all over, and suffered from a slight feeling of nausea.
      He guessed it came from fright, not of any bodily harm that might come to
      him, but of the probability of failure in his adventure and of its most
      momentous possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger pulled his coat collar up around his ears, hiding the lower
      portion of his face, but not concealing the resemblance in his troubled
      eyes and close-shut lips to the likenesses of the murderer Hade.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Torresdale in half an hour, and the stranger, alighting
      quickly, struck off at a rapid pace down the country road leading to the
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher gave him a hundred yards&#8217; start, and then followed slowly
      after. The road ran between fields and past a few frame-houses set far
      from the road in kitchen gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice the man looked back over his shoulder, but he saw only a
      dreary length of road with a small boy splashing through the slush in the
      midst of it and stopping every now and again to throw snowballs at belated
      sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a ten minutes&#8217; walk the stranger turned into a side road which
      led to only one place, the Eagle Inn, an old roadside hostelry known now
      as the headquarters for pothunters from the Philadelphia game market and
      the battleground of many a cock-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher knew the place well. He and his young companions had often
      stopped there when out chestnutting on holidays in the autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son of the man who kept it had often accompanied them on their
      excursions, and though the boys of the city streets considered him a dumb
      lout, they respected him somewhat owing to his inside knowledge of dog and
      cock-fights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger entered the inn at a side door, and Gallegher, reaching it a
      few minutes later, let him go for the time being, and set about finding
      his occasional playmate, young Keppler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keppler&#8217;s offspring was found in the woodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Tain&#8217;t hard to guess what brings you out here,&#8221; said
      the tavern-keeper&#8217;s son, with a grin; &#8220;it&#8217;s the fight.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What fight?&#8221; asked Gallegher, unguardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What fight? Why, <i>the</i> fight,&#8221; returned his companion,
      with the slow contempt of superior knowledge. &#8220;It&#8217;s to come
      off here to-night. You knew that as well as me; anyway your sportin&#8217;
      editor knows it. He got the tip last night, but that won&#8217;t help you
      any. You needn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any chance of your getting a
      peep at it. Why, tickets is two hundred and fifty apiece!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Gallegher, &#8220;where&#8217;s it to be?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In the barn,&#8221; whispered Keppler. &#8220;I helped &#8217;em
      fix the ropes this morning, I did.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gosh, but you&#8217;re in luck,&#8221; exclaimed Gallegher, with
      flattering envy. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I jest get a peep at it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said the gratified Keppler. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
      winder with a wooden shutter at the back of the barn. You can get in by
      it, if you have some one to boost you up to the sill.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sa-a-y,&#8221; drawled Gallegher, as if something had but just that
      moment reminded him. &#8220;Who&#8217;s that gent who come down the road
      just a bit ahead of me&#8211;him with the cape-coat! Has he got anything
      to do with the fight?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Him?&#8221; repeated Keppler in tones of sincere disgust. &#8220;No-oh,
      he ain&#8217;t no sport. He&#8217;s queer, Dad thinks. He come here one
      day last week about ten in the morning, said his doctor told him to go out
      &#8217;en the country for his health. He&#8217;s stuck up and citified,
      and wears gloves, and takes his meals private in his room, and all that
      sort of ruck. They was saying in the saloon last night that they thought
      he was hiding from something, and Dad, just to try him, asks him last
      night if he was coming to see the fight. He looked sort of scared, and
      said he didn&#8217;t want to see no fight. And then Dad says, &#8216;I
      guess you mean you don&#8217;t want no fighters to see you.&#8217; Dad
      didn&#8217;t mean no harm by it, just passed it as a joke; but Mr.
      Carleton, as he calls himself, got white as a ghost an&#8217; says,
      &#8216;I&#8217;ll go to the fight willing enough,&#8217; and begins to
      laugh and joke. And this morning he went right into the bar-room, where
      all the sports were setting, and said he was going into town to see some
      friends; and as he starts off he laughs an&#8217; says, &#8216;This don&#8217;t
      look as if I was afraid of seeing people, does it?&#8217; but Dad says it
      was just bluff that made him do it, and Dad thinks that if he hadn&#8217;t
      said what he did, this Mr. Carleton wouldn&#8217;t have left his room at
      all.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher had got all he wanted, and much more than he had hoped for&#8211;so
      much more that his walk back to the station was in the nature of a
      triumphal march.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had twenty minutes to wait for the next train, and it seemed an hour.
      While waiting he sent a telegram to Hefflefinger at his hotel. It read:
    </p>
    <div class="bquote">
      <p>
        Your man is near the Torresdale station, on Pennsylvania Railroad; take
        cab, and meet me at station. Wait until I come.
      </p>
      <p class="tar">
        Gallegher.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--  block quote -->
    <p>
      With the exception of one at midnight, no other train stopped at
      Torresdale that evening, hence the direction to take a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train to the city seemed to Gallegher to drag itself by inches. It
      stopped and backed at purposeless intervals, waited for an express to
      precede it, and dallied at stations, and when, at last, it reached the
      terminus, Gallegher was out before it had stopped and was in the cab and
      off on his way to the home of the sporting editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sporting editor was at dinner and came out in the hall to see him,
      with his napkin in his hand. Gallegher explained breathlessly that he had
      located the murderer for whom the police of two continents were looking,
      and that he believed, in order to quiet the suspicions of the people with
      whom he was hiding, that he would be present at the fight that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sporting editor led Gallegher into his library and shut the door.
      &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go over all that again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher went over it again in detail, and added how he had sent for
      Hefflefinger to make the arrest in order that it might be kept from the
      knowledge of the local police and from the Philadelphia reporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What I want Hefflefinger to do is to arrest Hade with the warrant
      he has for the burglar,&#8221; explained Gallegher; &#8220;and to take him
      on to New York on the owl train that passes Torresdale at one. It don&#8217;t
      get to Jersey City until four o&#8217;clock, one hour after the morning
      papers go to press. Of course, we must fix Hefflefinger so&#8217;s he&#8217;ll
      keep quiet and not tell who his prisoner really is.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sporting editor reached his hand out to pat Gallegher on the head, but
      changed his mind and shook hands with him instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are an infant phenomenon. If I
      can pull the rest of this thing off to-night it will mean the $5,000
      reward and fame galore for you and the paper. Now, I&#8217;m going to
      write a note to the managing editor, and you can take it around to him and
      tell him what you&#8217;ve done and what I am going to do, and he&#8217;ll
      take you back on the paper and raise your salary. Perhaps you didn&#8217;t
      know you&#8217;ve been discharged?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you think you ain&#8217;t a-going to take me with you?&#8221;
      demanded Gallegher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, certainly not. Why should I? It all lies with the detective
      and myself now. You&#8217;ve done your share, and done it well. If the man&#8217;s
      caught, the reward&#8217;s yours. But you&#8217;d only be in the way now.
      You&#8217;d better go to the office and make your peace with the chief.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If the paper can get along without me, I can get along without the
      old paper,&#8221; said Gallegher, hotly. &#8220;And if I ain&#8217;t
      a-going with you, you ain&#8217;t neither, for I know where Hefflefinger
      is to be, and you don&#8217;t, and I won&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, very well, very well,&#8221; replied the sporting editor,
      weakly capitulating. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send the note by a messenger; only
      mind, if you lose your place, don&#8217;t blame me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher wondered how this man could value a week&#8217;s salary against
      the excitement of seeing a noted criminal run down, and of getting the
      news to the paper, and to that one paper alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment the sporting editor sank in Gallegher&#8217;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dwyer sat down at his desk and scribbled off the following note:
    </p>
    <div class="bquote">
      <p>
        I have received reliable information that Hade, the Burrbank murderer,
        will be present at the fight to-night. We have arranged it so that he
        will be arrested quietly and in such a manner that the fact may be kept
        from all other papers. I need not point out to you that this will be the
        most important piece of news in the country to-morrow. Yours, etc.,
      </p>
      <p class="tar">
        Michael E. Dwyer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--  block quote -->
    <p>
      The sporting editor stepped into the waiting cab, while Gallegher
      whispered the directions to the driver. He was told to go first to a
      district-messenger office, and from there up to the Ridge Avenue Road, out
      Broad Street, and on to the old Eagle Inn, near Torresdale.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      It was a miserable night. The rain and snow were falling together, and
      freezing as they fell. The sporting editor got out to send his message to
      the <i>Press</i> office, and then lighting a cigar, and turning up the
      collar of his great-coat, curled up in the corner of the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wake me when we get there, Gallegher,&#8221; he said. He knew he
      had a long ride, and much rapid work before him, and he was preparing for
      the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Gallegher the idea of going to sleep seemed almost criminal. From the
      dark corner of the cab his eyes shone with excitement, and with the awful
      joy of anticipation. He glanced every now and then to where the sporting
      editor&#8217;s cigar shone in the darkness, and watched it as it gradually
      burnt more dimly and went out. The lights in the shop windows threw a
      broad glare across the ice on the pavements, and the lights from the
      lamp-posts tossed the distorted shadow of the cab, and the horse, and the
      motionless driver, sometimes before and sometimes behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half an hour Gallegher slipped down to the bottom of the cab and
      dragged out a lap-robe, in which he wrapped himself. It was growing
      colder, and the damp, keen wind swept in through the cracks until the
      window-frames and woodwork were cold to the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, and the cab was still moving more slowly over the rough
      surface of partly paved streets, and by single rows of new houses standing
      at different angles to each other in fields covered with ash-heaps and
      brick-kilns. Here and there the gaudy lights of a drug-store, and the
      forerunner of suburban civilization, shone from the end of a new block of
      houses, and the rubber cape of an occasional policeman showed in the light
      of the lamp-post that he hugged for comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then even the houses disappeared, and the cab dragged its way between
      truck farms, with desolate-looking glass-covered beds, and pools of water,
      half-caked with ice, and bare trees, and interminable fences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice the cab stopped altogether, and Gallegher could hear the
      driver swearing to himself, or at the horse, or the roads. At last they
      drew up before the station at Torresdale. It was quite deserted, and only
      a single light cut a swath in the darkness and showed a portion of the
      platform, the ties, and the rails glistening in the rain. They walked
      twice past the light before a figure stepped out of the shadow and greeted
      them cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am Mr. Dwyer, of the <i>Press</i>,&#8221; said the sporting
      editor, briskly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of me, perhaps. Well, there
      shouldn&#8217;t be any difficulty in our making a deal, should there? This
      boy here has found Hade, and we have reason to believe he will be among
      the spectators at the fight to-night. We want you to arrest him quietly,
      and as secretly as possible. You can do it with your papers and your badge
      easily enough. We want you to pretend that you believe he is this burglar
      you came over after. If you will do this, and take him away without any
      one so much as suspecting who he really is, and on the train that passes
      here at 1.20 for New York, we will give you $500 out of the $5,000 reward.
      If, however, one other paper, either in New York or Philadelphia, or
      anywhere else, knows of the arrest, you won&#8217;t get a cent. Now, what
      do you say?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective had a great deal to say. He wasn&#8217;t at all sure the man
      Gallegher suspected was Hade; he feared he might get himself into trouble
      by making a false arrest, and if it should be the man, he was afraid the
      local police would interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve no time to argue or debate this matter,&#8221; said
      Dwyer, warmly. &#8220;We agree to point Hade out to you in the crowd.
      After the fight is over you arrest him as we have directed, and you get
      the money and the credit of the arrest. If you don&#8217;t like this, I
      will arrest the man myself, and have him driven to town, with a pistol for
      a warrant.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hefflefinger considered in silence and then agreed unconditionally.
      &#8220;As you say, Mr. Dwyer,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
      of you for a thoroughbred sport. I know you&#8217;ll do what you say you&#8217;ll
      do; and as for me I&#8217;ll do what you say and just as you say, and it&#8217;s
      a very pretty piece of work as it stands.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stepped back into the cab, and then it was that they were met by
      a fresh difficulty, how to get the detective into the barn where the fight
      was to take place, for neither of the two men had $250 to pay for his
      admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was overcome when Gallegher remembered the window of which young
      Keppler had told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of Hade&#8217;s losing courage and not daring to show himself
      in the crowd around the ring, it was agreed that Dwyer should come to the
      barn and warn Hefflefinger; but if he should come, Dwyer was merely to
      keep near him and to signify by a prearranged gesture which one of the
      crowd he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew up before a great black shadow of a house, dark, forbidding, and
      apparently deserted. But at the sound of the wheels on the gravel the door
      opened, letting out a stream of warm, cheerful light, and a man&#8217;s
      voice said, &#8220;Put out those lights. Don&#8217;t youse know no better
      than that?&#8221; This was Keppler, and he welcomed Mr. Dwyer with
      effusive courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men showed in the stream of light, and the door closed on them,
      leaving the house as it was at first, black and silent, save for the
      dripping of the rain and snow from the eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective and Gallegher put out the cab&#8217;s lamps and led the
      horse toward a long, low shed in the rear of the yard, which they now
      noticed was almost filled with teams of many different makes, from the
      Hobson&#8217;s choice of a livery stable to the brougham of the man about
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No,&#8221; said Gallegher, as the cabman stopped to hitch the horse
      beside the others, &#8220;we want it nearest that lower gate. When we
      newspaper men leave this place we&#8217;ll leave it in a hurry, and the
      man who is nearest town is likely to get there first. You won&#8217;t be
      a-following of no hearse when you make your return trip.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher tied the horse to the very gate-post itself, leaving the gate
      open and allowing a clear road and a flying start for the prospective race
      to Newspaper Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver disappeared under the shelter of the porch, and Gallegher and
      the detective moved off cautiously to the rear of the barn. &#8220;This
      must be the window,&#8221; said Hefflefinger, pointing to a broad wooden
      shutter some feet from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just you give me a boost once, and I&#8217;ll get that open in a
      jiffy,&#8221; said Gallegher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective placed his hands on his knees, and Gallegher stood upon his
      shoulders, and with the blade of his knife lifted the wooden button that
      fastened the window on the inside, and pulled the shutter open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he put one leg inside over the sill, and leaning down helped to draw
      his fellow-conspirator up to a level with the window. &#8220;I feel just
      like I was burglarizing a house,&#8221; chuckled Gallegher, as he dropped
      noiselessly to the floor below and refastened the shutter. The barn was a
      large one, with a row of stalls on either side in which horses and cows
      were dozing. There was a haymow over each row of stalls, and at one end of
      the barn a number of fence-rails had been thrown across from one mow to
      the other. These rails were covered with hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the floor was the ring. It was not really a ring, but a
      square, with wooden posts at its four corners through which ran a heavy
      rope. The space enclosed by the rope was covered with sawdust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher could not resist stepping into the ring, and after stamping the
      sawdust once or twice, as if to assure himself that he was really there,
      began dancing around it, and indulging in such a remarkable series of
      fistic man&oelig;uvres with an imaginary adversary that the unimaginative
      detective precipitately backed into a corner of the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said Gallegher, having apparently vanquished his
      foe, &#8220;you come with me.&#8221; His companion followed quickly as
      Gallegher climbed to one of the hay-mows, and, crawling carefully out on
      the fence-rail, stretched himself at full length, face downward. In this
      position, by moving the straw a little, he could look down, without being
      himself seen, upon the heads of whomsoever stood below. &#8220;This is
      better&#8217;n a private box, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Gallegher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy from the newspaper office and the detective lay there in silence,
      biting at straws and tossing anxiously on their comfortable bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed fully two hours before they came. Gallegher had listened without
      breathing, and with every muscle on a strain, at least a dozen times, when
      some movement in the yard had led him to believe that they were at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had numerous doubts and fears. Sometimes it was that the police had
      learnt of the fight, and had raided Keppler&#8217;s in his absence, and
      again it was that the fight had been postponed, or, worst of all, that it
      would be put off until so late that Mr. Dwyer could not get back in time
      for the last edition of the paper. Their coming, when at last they came,
      was heralded by an advance-guard of two sporting men, who stationed
      themselves at either side of the big door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hurry up, now, gents,&#8221; one of the men said with a shiver,
      &#8220;don&#8217;t keep this door open no longer&#8217;n is needful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a very large crowd, but it was wonderfully well selected. It
      ran, in the majority of its component parts, to heavy white coats with
      pearl buttons. The white coats were shouldered by long blue coats with
      astrakhan fur trimmings, the wearers of which preserved a cliqueness not
      remarkable when one considers that they believed every one else present to
      be either a crook or a prize-fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were well-fed, well-groomed club-men and brokers in the crowd, a
      politician or two, a popular comedian with his manager, amateur boxers
      from the athletic clubs, and quiet, close-mouthed sporting men from every
      city in the country. Their names if printed in the papers would have been
      as familiar as the types of the papers themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And among these men, whose only thought was of the brutal sport to come,
      was Hade, with Dwyer standing at ease at his shoulder&#8211;Hade, white,
      and visibly in deep anxiety, hiding his pale face beneath a cloth
      travelling-cap, and with his chin muffled in a woollen scarf. He had dared
      to come because he feared his danger from the already suspicious Keppler
      was less than if he stayed away. And so he was there, hovering restlessly
      on the border of the crowd, feeling his danger and sick with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hefflefinger first saw him he started up on his hands and elbows and
      made a movement forward as if he would leap down then and there and carry
      off his prisoner single-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Lie down,&#8221; growled Gallegher; &#8220;an officer of any sort
      wouldn&#8217;t live three minutes in that crowd.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective drew back slowly and buried himself again in the straw, but
      never once through the long fight which followed did his eyes leave the
      person of the murderer. The newspaper men took their places in the
      foremost row close around the ring, and kept looking at their watches and
      begging the master of ceremonies to &#8220;shake it up, do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of betting, and all of the men handled the great
      rolls of bills they wagered with a flippant recklessness which could only
      be accounted for in Gallegher&#8217;s mind by temporary mental
      derangement. Some one pulled a box out into the ring and the master of
      ceremonies mounted it, and pointed out in forcible language that as they
      were almost all already under bonds to keep the peace, it behooved all to
      curb their excitement and to maintain a severe silence, unless they wanted
      to bring the police upon them and have themselves &#8220;sent down&#8221;
      for a year or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then two very disreputable-looking persons tossed their respective
      principals&#8217; high hats into the ring, and the crowd, recognizing in
      this relic of the days when brave knights threw down their gauntlets in
      the lists as only a sign that the fight was about to begin, cheered
      tumultuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed by a sudden surging forward, and a mutter of admiration
      much more flattering than the cheers had been, when the principals
      followed their hats and, slipping out of their great-coats, stood forth in
      all the physical beauty of the perfect brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pink skin was as soft and healthy-looking as a baby&#8217;s, and
      glowed in the lights of the lanterns like tinted ivory, and underneath
      this silken covering the great biceps and muscles moved in and out and
      looked like the coils of a snake around the branch of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentleman and blackguard shouldered each other for a nearer view; the
      coachmen, whose metal buttons were unpleasantly suggestive of police, put
      their hands, in the excitement of the moment, on the shoulders of their
      masters; the perspiration stood out in great drops on the foreheads of the
      backers, and the newspaper men bit somewhat nervously at the ends of their
      pencils.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the stalls the cows munched contentedly at their cuds and gazed
      with gentle curiosity at their two fellow-brutes, who stood waiting the
      signal to fall upon and kill each other, if need be, for the delectation
      of their brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Take your places,&#8221; commanded the master of ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment in which the two men faced each other the crowd became so
      still that, save for the beating of the rain upon the shingled roof and
      the stamping of a horse in one of the stalls, the place was as silent as a
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Time,&#8221; shouted the master of ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men sprang into a posture of defense, which was lost as quickly as
      it was taken, one great arm shot out like a piston-rod; there was the
      sound of bare fists beating on naked flesh; there was an exultant indrawn
      gasp of savage pleasure and relief from the crowd, and the great fight had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the fortunes of war rose and fell, and changed and rechanged that
      night, is an old story to those who listen to such stories; and those who
      do not will be glad to be spared the telling of it. It was, they say, one
      of the bitterest fights between two men that this country has ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all that is of interest here is that after an hour of this desperate,
      brutal business the champion ceased to be the favorite; the man whom he
      had taunted and bullied, and for whom the public had but little sympathy,
      was proving himself a likely winner, and under his cruel blows, as sharp
      and clean as those from a cutlass, his opponent was rapidly giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men about the ropes were past all control now; they drowned Keppler&#8217;s
      petitions for silence with oaths and in inarticulate shouts of anger, as
      if the blows had fallen upon them, and in mad rejoicings. They swept from
      one end of the ring to the other, with every muscle leaping in unison with
      those of the man they favored, and when a New York correspondent muttered
      over his shoulder that this would be the biggest sporting surprise since
      the Heenan-Sayers fight, Mr. Dwyer nodded his head sympathetically in
      assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the excitement and tumult it is doubtful if any heard the three quickly
      repeated blows that fell heavily from the outside upon the big doors of
      the barn. If they did, it was already too late to mend matters, for the
      door fell, torn from its hinges, and as it fell a captain of police sprang
      into the light from out of the storm, with his lieutenants and their men
      crowding close at his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the panic and stampede that followed, several of the men stood as
      helplessly immovable as though they had seen a ghost; others made a mad
      rush into the arms of the officers and were beaten back against the ropes
      of the ring; others dived headlong into the stalls, among the horses and
      cattle, and still others shoved the rolls of money they held into the
      hands of the police and begged like children to be allowed to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant the door fell and the raid was declared Hefflefinger slipped
      over the cross rails on which he had been lying, hung for an instant by
      his hands, and then dropped into the centre of the fighting mob on the
      floor. He was out of it in an instant with the agility of a pickpocket,
      was across the room and at Hade&#8217;s throat like a dog. The murderer,
      for the moment, was the calmer man of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here,&#8221; he panted, &#8220;hands off, now. There&#8217;s no
      need for all this violence. There&#8217;s no great harm in looking at a
      fight, is there? There&#8217;s a hundred-dollar bill in my right hand;
      take it and let me slip out of this. No one is looking. Here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the detective only held him the closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I want you for burglary,&#8221; he whispered under his breath.
      &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to come with me now, and quick. The less fuss you
      make, the better for both of us. If you don&#8217;t know who I am, you can
      feel my badge under my coat there. I&#8217;ve got the authority. It&#8217;s
      all regular, and when we&#8217;re out of this d&#8211;d row I&#8217;ll
      show you the papers.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took one hand from Hade&#8217;s throat and pulled a pair of handcuffs
      from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake. This is an outrage,&#8221; gasped the
      murderer, white and trembling, but dreadfully alive and desperate for his
      liberty. &#8220;Let me go, I tell you! Take your hands off of me! Do I
      look like a burglar, you fool?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know who you look like,&#8221; whispered the detective, with his
      face close to the face of his prisoner. &#8220;Now, will you go easy as a
      burglar, or shall I tell these men who you are and what I <i>do</i> want
      you for? Shall I call out your real name or not? Shall I tell them? Quick,
      speak up; shall I?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so exultant&#8211;something so unnecessarily savage in
      the officer&#8217;s face that the man he held saw that the detective knew
      him for what he really was, and the hands that had held his throat slipped
      down around his shoulders, or he would have fallen. The man&#8217;s eyes
      opened and closed again, and he swayed weakly backward and forward, and
      choked as if his throat were dry and burning. Even to such a hardened
      connoisseur in crime as Gallegher, who stood closely by, drinking it in,
      there was something so abject in the man&#8217;s terror that he regarded
      him with what was almost a touch of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Hade begged, &#8220;let me go. Come
      with me to my room and I&#8217;ll give you half the money. I&#8217;ll
      divide with you fairly. We can both get away. There&#8217;s a fortune for
      both of us there. We both can get away. You&#8217;ll be rich for life. Do
      you understand&#8211;for life!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the detective, to his credit, only shut his lips the tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; he whispered, in return. &#8220;That&#8217;s
      more than I expected. You&#8217;ve sentenced yourself already. Come!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two officers in uniform barred their exit at the door, but Hefflefinger
      smiled easily and showed his badge.
    </p>

    <!--  figure -->
    <p>
      &#8220;One of Byrnes&#8217;s men,&#8221; he said, in explanation; &#8220;came
      over expressly to take this chap. He&#8217;s a burglar; &#8216;Arlie&#8217;
      Lane, <i>alias</i> Carleton. I&#8217;ve shown the papers to the captain.
      It&#8217;s all regular. I&#8217;m just going to get his traps at the hotel
      and walk him over to the station. I guess we&#8217;ll push right on to New
      York to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers nodded and smiled their admiration for the representative of
      what is, perhaps, the best detective force in the world, and let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hefflefinger turned and spoke to Gallegher, who still stood as
      watchful as a dog at his side. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to his room to get
      the bonds and stuff,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;then I&#8217;ll march him
      to the station and take that train. I&#8217;ve done my share; don&#8217;t
      forget yours!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll get your money right enough,&#8221; said
      Gallegher. &#8220;And, sa-ay,&#8221; he added, with the appreciative nod
      of an expert, &#8220;do you know, you did it rather well.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dwyer had been writing while the raid was settling down, as he had
      been writing while waiting for the fight to begin. Now he walked over to
      where the other correspondents stood in angry conclave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper men had informed the officers who hemmed them in that they
      represented the principal papers of the country, and were expostulating
      vigorously with the captain, who had planned the raid, and who declared
      they were under arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t be an ass, Scott,&#8221; said Mr. Dwyer, who was too
      excited to be polite or politic. &#8220;You know our being here isn&#8217;t
      a matter of choice. We came here on business, as you did, and you&#8217;ve
      no right to hold us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If we don&#8217;t get our stuff on the wire at once,&#8221;
      protested a New York man, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be too late for to-morrow&#8217;s
      paper, and&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Scott said he did not care a profanely small amount for to-morrow&#8217;s
      paper, and that all he knew was that to the station-house the newspaper
      men would go. There they would have a hearing, and if the magistrate chose
      to let them off, that was the magistrate&#8217;s business, but that his
      duty was to take them into custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But then it will be too late, don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;
      shouted Mr. Dwyer. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to let us go <i>now</i>, at
      once.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, Mr. Dwyer,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;and
      that&#8217;s all there is to it. Why, haven&#8217;t I just sent the
      president of the Junior Republican Club to the patrol-wagon, the man that
      put this coat on me, and do you think I can let you fellows go after that?
      You were all put under bonds to keep the peace not three days ago, and
      here you&#8217;re at it&#8211;fighting like badgers. It&#8217;s worth my
      place to let one of you off.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mr. Dwyer said next was so uncomplimentary to the gallant Captain
      Scott that that overwrought individual seized the sporting editor by the
      shoulder, and shoved him into the hands of two of his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was more than the distinguished Mr. Dwyer could brook, and he
      excitedly raised his hand in resistance. But before he had time to do
      anything foolish his wrist was gripped by one strong little hand, and he
      was conscious that another was picking the pocket of his great-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slapped his hands to his sides, and, looking down, saw Gallegher
      standing close behind him and holding him by the wrist. Mr. Dwyer had
      forgotten the boy&#8217;s existence, and would have spoken sharply if
      something in Gallegher&#8217;s innocent eyes had not stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher&#8217;s hand was still in that pocket in which Mr. Dwyer had
      shoved his notebook filled with what he had written of Gallegher&#8217;s
      work and Hade&#8217;s final capture, and with a running descriptive
      account of the fight. With his eyes fixed on Mr. Dwyer, Gallegher drew it
      out, and with a quick movement shoved it inside his waistcoat. Mr. Dwyer
      gave a nod of comprehension. Then glancing at his two guardsmen, and
      finding that they were still interested in the wordy battle of the
      correspondents with their chief, and had seen nothing, he stooped and
      whispered to Gallegher: &#8220;The forms are locked at twenty minutes to
      three. If you don&#8217;t get there by that time it will be of no use, but
      if you&#8217;re on time you&#8217;ll beat the town&#8211;and the country
      too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher&#8217;s eyes flashed significantly, and, nodding his head to
      show he understood, started boldly on a run toward the door. But the
      officers who guarded it brought him to an abrupt halt, and, much to Mr.
      Dwyer&#8217;s astonishment, drew from him what was apparently a torrent of
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let me go to me father. I want me father,&#8221; the boy shrieked
      hysterically. &#8220;They&#8217;ve &#8217;rested father. Oh, daddy, daddy.
      They&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to take you to prison.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who is your father, sonny?&#8221; asked one of the guardians of the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Keppler&#8217;s me father,&#8221; sobbed Gallegher. &#8220;They&#8217;re
      a-goin&#8217; to lock him up, and I&#8217;ll never see him no more.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, yes, you will,&#8221; said the officer, good-naturedly; &#8220;he&#8217;s
      there in that first patrol-wagon. You can run over and say good night to
      him, and then you&#8217;d better get to bed. This ain&#8217;t no place for
      kids of your age.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; sniffed Gallegher, tearfully, as the two
      officers raised their clubs, and let him pass out into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard outside was in a tumult, horses were stamping, and plunging, and
      backing the carriages into one another; lights were flashing from every
      window of what had been apparently an uninhabited house, and the voices of
      the prisoners were still raised in angry expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three police patrol-wagons were moving about the yard, filled with
      unwilling passengers, who sat or stood, packed together like sheep and
      with no protection from the sleet and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher stole off into a dark corner, and watched the scene until his
      eyesight became familiar with the position of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with his eyes fixed fearfully on the swinging light of a lantern with
      which an officer was searching among the carriages, he groped his way
      between horses&#8217; hoofs and behind the wheels of carriages to the cab
      which he had himself placed at the furthermost gate. It was still there,
      and the horse, as he had left it, with its head turned toward the city.
      Gallegher opened the big gate noiselessly, and worked nervously at the
      hitching strap. The knot was covered with a thin coating of ice, and it
      was several minutes before he could loosen it. But his teeth finally
      pulled it apart, and with the reins in his hands he sprang upon the wheel.
      And as he stood so, a shock of fear ran down his back like an electric
      current, his breath left him, and he stood immovable, gazing with wide
      eyes into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer with the lantern had suddenly loomed up from behind a carriage
      not fifty feet distant, and was standing perfectly still, with his lantern
      held over his head, peering so directly toward Gallegher that the boy felt
      that he must see him. Gallegher stood with one foot on the hub of the
      wheel and with the other on the box waiting to spring. It seemed a minute
      before either of them moved, and then the officer took a step forward, and
      demanded sternly, &#8220;Who is that? What are you doing there?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for parley then. Gallegher felt that he had been taken
      in the act, and that his only chance lay in open flight. He leaped up on
      the box, pulling out the whip as he did so, and with a quick sweep lashed
      the horse across the head and back. The animal sprang forward with a
      snort, narrowly clearing the gate-post, and plunged off into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many of Gallegher&#8217;s acquaintances among the &#8217;longshoremen
      and mill hands had been challenged in so much the same manner that
      Gallegher knew what would probably follow if the challenge was
      disregarded. So he slipped from his seat to the footboard below, and
      ducked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three reports of a pistol, which rang out briskly from behind him,
      proved that his early training had given him a valuable fund of useful
      miscellaneous knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you be scared,&#8221; he said, reassuringly, to the
      horse; &#8220;he&#8217;s firing in the air.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pistol-shots were answered by the impatient clangor of a patrol-wagon&#8217;s
      gong, and glancing over his shoulder Gallegher saw its red and green
      lanterns tossing from side to side and looking in the darkness like the
      side-lights of a yacht plunging forward in a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t bargained to race you against no patrol-wagons,&#8221;
      said Gallegher to his animal; &#8220;but if they want a race, we&#8217;ll
      give them a tough tussle for it, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Philadelphia, lying four miles to the south, sent up a faint yellow glow
      to the sky. It seemed very far away, and Gallegher&#8217;s braggadocio
      grew cold within him at the loneliness of his adventure and the thought of
      the long ride before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still bitterly cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain and sleet beat through his clothes, and struck his skin with a
      sharp, chilling touch that set him trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the thought of the over-weighted patrol-wagon probably sticking in
      the mud some safe distance in the rear, failed to cheer him, and the
      excitement that had so far made him callous to the cold died out and left
      him weaker and nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his horse was chilled with the long standing, and now leaped eagerly
      forward, only too willing to warm the half-frozen blood in its veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;re a good beast,&#8221; said Gallegher, plaintively.
      &#8220;You&#8217;ve got more nerve than me. Don&#8217;t you go back on me
      now. Mr. Dwyer says we&#8217;ve got to beat the town.&#8221; Gallegher had
      no idea what time it was as he rode through the night, but he knew he
      would be able to find out from a big clock over a manufactory at a point
      nearly three-quarters of the distance from Keppler&#8217;s to the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still in the open country and driving recklessly, for he knew the
      best part of his ride must be made outside the city limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raced between desolate-looking cornfields with bare stalks and patches
      of muddy earth rising above the thin covering of snow; truck farms and
      brick-yards fell behind him on either side. It was very lonely work, and
      once or twice the dogs ran yelping to the gates and barked after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of his way lay parallel with the railroad tracks, and he drove for
      some time beside long lines of freight and coal cars as they stood resting
      for the night. The fantastic Queen Anne suburban stations were dark and
      deserted, but in one or two of the block-towers he could see the operators
      writing at their desks, and the sight in some way comforted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he thought of stopping to get out the blanket in which he had wrapped
      himself on the first trip, but he feared to spare the time, and drove on
      with his teeth chattering and his shoulders shaking with the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He welcomed the first solitary row of darkened houses with a faint cheer
      of recognition. The scattered lamp-posts lightened his spirits, and even
      the badly paved streets rang under the beats of his horse&#8217;s feet
      like music. Great mills and manufactories, with only a night-watchman&#8217;s
      light in the lowest of their many stories, began to take the place of the
      gloomy farm-houses and gaunt trees that had startled him with their
      grotesque shapes. He had been driving nearly an hour, he calculated, and
      in that time the rain had changed to a wet snow, that fell heavily and
      clung to whatever it touched. He passed block after block of trim work-men&#8217;s
      houses, as still and silent as the sleepers within them, and at last he
      turned the horse&#8217;s head into Broad Street, the city&#8217;s great
      thoroughfare, that stretches from its one end to the other and cuts it
      evenly in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was driving noiselessly over the snow and slush in the street, with his
      thoughts bent only on the clock-face he wished so much to see, when a
      hoarse voice challenged him from the sidewalk. &#8220;Hey, you, stop
      there, hold up!&#8221; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher turned his head, and though he saw that the voice came from
      under a policeman&#8217;s helmet, his only answer was to hit his horse
      sharply over the head with his whip and to urge it into a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, on his part, was followed by a sharp, shrill whistle from the
      policeman. Another whistle answered it from a street-corner one block
      ahead of him. &#8220;Whoa,&#8221; said Gallegher, pulling on the reins.
      &#8220;There&#8217;s one too many of them,&#8221; he added, in apologetic
      explanation. The horse stopped, and stood, breathing heavily, with great
      clouds of steam rising from its flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why in hell didn&#8217;t you stop when I told you to?&#8221;
      demanded the voice, now close at the cab&#8217;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear you,&#8221; returned Gallegher, sweetly.
      &#8220;But I heard you whistle, and I heard your partner whistle, and I
      thought maybe it was me you wanted to speak to, so I just stopped.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You heard me well enough. Why aren&#8217;t your lights lit?&#8221;
      demanded the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Should I have &#8217;em lit?&#8221; asked Gallegher, bending over
      and regarding them with sudden interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You know you should, and if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ve no right
      to be driving that cab. I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re the regular
      driver, anyway. Where&#8217;d you get it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It ain&#8217;t my cab, of course,&#8221; said Gallegher, with an
      easy laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s Luke McGovern&#8217;s. He left it outside
      Cronin&#8217;s while he went in to get a drink, and he took too much, and
      me father told me to drive it round to the stable for him. I&#8217;m
      Cronin&#8217;s son. McGovern ain&#8217;t in no condition to drive. You can
      see yourself how he&#8217;s been misusing the horse. He puts it up at
      Bachman&#8217;s livery stable, and I was just going around there now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher&#8217;s knowledge of the local celebrities of the district
      confused the zealous officer of the peace. He surveyed the boy with a
      steady stare that would have distressed a less skilful liar, but Gallegher
      only shrugged his shoulders slightly, as if from the cold, and waited with
      apparent indifference to what the officer would say next.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality his heart was beating heavily against his side, and he felt
      that if he was kept on a strain much longer he would give way and break
      down. A second snow-covered form emerged suddenly from the shadow of the
      houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it, Reeder?&#8221; it asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, nothing much,&#8221; replied the first officer. &#8220;This kid
      hadn&#8217;t any lamps lit, so I called to him to stop and he didn&#8217;t
      do it, so I whistled to you. It&#8217;s all right, though. He&#8217;s just
      taking it round to Bachman&#8217;s. Go ahead,&#8221; he added, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Get up!&#8221; chirped Gallegher. &#8220;Good night,&#8221; he
      added, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher gave a hysterical little gasp of relief as he trotted away from
      the two policemen, and poured bitter maledictions on their heads for two
      meddling fools as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They might as well kill a man as scare him to death,&#8221; he
      said, with an attempt to get back to his customary flippancy. But the
      effort was somewhat pitiful, and he felt guiltily conscious that a salt,
      warm tear was creeping slowly down his face, and that a lump that would
      not keep down was rising in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Tain&#8217;t no fair thing for the whole police force to keep
      worrying at a little boy like me,&#8221; he said, in shame-faced apology.
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing nothing wrong, and I&#8217;m half froze to
      death, and yet they keep a-nagging at me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so cold that when the boy stamped his feet against the footboard to
      keep them warm, sharp pains shot up through his body, and when he beat his
      arms about his shoulders, as he had seen real cabmen do, the blood in his
      finger-tips tingled so acutely that he cried aloud with the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often been up that late before, but he had never felt so sleepy. It
      was as if some one was pressing a sponge heavy with chloroform near his
      face, and he could not fight off the drowsiness that lay hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, dimly hanging above his head, a round disk of light that seemed
      like a great moon, and which he finally guessed to be the clock-face for
      which he had been on the lookout. He had passed it before he realized
      this; but the fact stirred him into wakefulness again, and when his cab&#8217;s
      wheels slipped around the City Hall corner, he remembered to look up at
      the other big clock-face that keeps awake over the railroad station and
      measures out the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a gasp of consternation when he saw that it was half-past two, and
      that there was but ten minutes left to him. This, and the many electric
      lights and the sight of the familiar pile of buildings, startled him into
      a semi-consciousness of where he was and how great was the necessity for
      haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose in his seat and called on the horse, and urged it into a reckless
      gallop over the slippery asphalt. He considered nothing else but speed,
      and looking neither to the left nor right dashed off down Broad Street
      into Chestnut, where his course lay straight away to the office, now only
      seven blocks distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher never knew how it began, but he was suddenly assaulted by shouts
      on either side, his horse was thrown back on its haunches, and he found
      two men in cabmen&#8217;s livery hanging at its head, and patting its
      sides, and calling it by name. And the other cabmen who have their stand
      at the corner were swarming about the carriage, all of them talking and
      swearing at once, and gesticulating wildly with their whips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said they knew the cab was McGovern&#8217;s, and they wanted to know
      where he was, and why he wasn&#8217;t on it; they wanted to know where
      Gallegher had stolen it, and why he had been such a fool as to drive it
      into the arms of its owner&#8217;s friends; they said that it was about
      time that a cab-driver could get off his box to take a drink without
      having his cab run away with, and some of them called loudly for a
      policeman to take the young thief in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallagher felt as if he had been suddenly dragged into consciousness out
      of a bad dream, and stood for a second like a half-awakened somnambulist.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped the cab under an electric light, and its glare shone
      coldly down upon the trampled snow and the faces of the men around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher bent forward, and lashed savagely at the horse with his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let me go,&#8221; he shouted, as he tugged impotently at the reins.
      &#8220;Let me go, I tell you. I haven&#8217;t stole no cab, and you&#8217;ve
      got no right to stop me. I only want to take it to the <i>Press</i>
      office,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;They&#8217;ll send it back to you all
      right. They&#8217;ll pay you for the trip. I&#8217;m not running away with
      it. The driver&#8217;s got the collar&#8211;he&#8217;s &#8217;rested&#8211;and
      I&#8217;m only a-going to the <i>Press</i> office. Do you hear me?&#8221;
      he cried, his voice rising and breaking in a shriek of passion and
      disappointment. &#8220;I tell you to let go those reins. Let me go, or I&#8217;ll
      kill you. Do you hear me? I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221; And leaning forward,
      the boy struck savagely with his long whip at the faces of the men about
      the horse&#8217;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one in the crowd reached up and caught him by the ankles, and with a
      quick jerk pulled him off the box, and threw him on to the street. But he
      was up on his knees in a moment, and caught at the man&#8217;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them stop me, mister,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;please
      let me go. I didn&#8217;t steal the cab, sir. S&#8217;help me, I didn&#8217;t.
      I&#8217;m telling you the truth. Take me to the <i>Press</i> office, and
      they&#8217;ll prove it to you. They&#8217;ll pay you anything you ask
      &#8217;em. It&#8217;s only such a little ways now, and I&#8217;ve come so
      far, sir. Please don&#8217;t let them stop me,&#8221; he sobbed, clasping
      the man about the knees. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, mister, let me
      go!&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      The managing editor of the <i>Press</i> took up the india-rubber
      speaking-tube at his side, and answered, &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; to an
      inquiry the night editor had already put to him five times within the last
      twenty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he snapped the metal top of the tube impatiently, and went up-stairs.
      As he passed the door of the local room, he noticed that the reporters had
      not gone home, but were sitting about on the tables and chairs, waiting.
      They looked up inquiringly as he passed, and the city editor asked,
      &#8220;Any news yet?&#8221; and the managing editor shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compositors were standing idle in the composing-room, and their
      foreman was talking with the night editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well,&#8221; said that gentleman, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well,&#8221; returned the managing editor, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
      think we can wait; do you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a half-hour after time now,&#8221; said the night
      editor, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll miss the suburban trains if we hold the
      paper back any longer. We can&#8217;t afford to wait for a purely
      hypothetical story. The chances are all against the fight&#8217;s having
      taken place or this Hade&#8217;s having been arrested.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But if we&#8217;re beaten on it&#8211;&#8221; suggested the chief.
      &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think that is possible. If there were any story
      to print, Dwyer would have had it here before now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor looked steadily down at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;we won&#8217;t wait any
      longer. Go ahead,&#8221; he added, turning to the foreman with a sigh of
      reluctance. The foreman whirled himself about, and began to give his
      orders; but the two editors still looked at each other doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood so, there came a sudden shout and the sound of people
      running to and fro in the reportorial rooms below. There was the tramp of
      many footsteps on the stairs, and above the confusion they heard the voice
      of the city editor telling some one to &#8220;run to Madden&#8217;s and
      get some brandy, quick.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one in the composing-room said anything; but those compositors who had
      started to go home began slipping off their overcoats, and every one stood
      with his eyes fixed on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was kicked open from the outside, and in the doorway stood a cab-driver
      and the city editor, supporting between them a pitiful little figure of a
      boy, wet and miserable, and with the snow melting on his clothes and
      running in little pools to the floor. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Gallegher,&#8221;
      said the night editor, in a tone of the keenest disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher shook himself free from his supporters, and took an unsteady
      step forward, his fingers fumbling stiffly with the buttons of his
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mr. Dwyer, sir,&#8221; he began faintly, with his eyes fixed
      fearfully on the managing editor, &#8220;he got arrested&#8211;and I
      couldn&#8217;t get here no sooner, &#8217;cause they kept a-stopping me,
      and they took me cab from under me&#8211;but&#8211;&#8221; he pulled the
      notebook from his breast and held it out with its covers damp and limp
      from the rain&#8211;&#8220;but we got Hade, and here&#8217;s Mr. Dwyer&#8217;s
      copy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he asked, with a queer note in his voice, partly of dread and
      partly of hope, &#8220;Am I in time, sir?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor took the book, and tossed it to the foreman, who
      ripped out its leaves and dealt them out to his men as rapidly as a
      gambler deals out cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the managing editor stooped and picked Gallegher up in his arms, and,
      sitting down, began to unlace his wet and muddy shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher made a faint effort to resist this degradation of the managerial
      dignity; but his protest was a very feeble one, and his head fell back
      heavily oh the managing editor&#8217;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Gallegher the incandescent lights began to whirl about in circles, and
      to burn in different colors; the faces of the reporters kneeling before
      him and chafing his hands and feet grew dim and unfamiliar, and the roar
      and rumble of the great presses in the basement sounded far away, like the
      murmur of the sea.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter">
      <img src="images/i-156.jpg" id="img004" alt="" />
      <p class="center caption">
        &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Gallegher,&#8221; said the night editor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--  figure -->
    <p>
      And then the place and the circumstances of it came back to him again
      sharply and with sudden vividness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher looked up, with a faint smile, into the managing editor&#8217;s
      face. &#8220;You won&#8217;t turn me off for running away, will you?&#8221;
      he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor did not answer immediately. His head was bent, and he
      was thinking, for some reason or other, of a little boy of his own, at
      home in bed. Then he said quietly, &#8220;Not this time, Gallegher.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallegher&#8217;s head sank back comfortably on the older man&#8217;s
      shoulder, and he smiled comprehensively at the faces of the young men
      crowded around him. &#8220;You hadn&#8217;t ought to,&#8221; he said, with
      a touch of his old impudence, &#8217;&#8220;cause&#8211;I beat the town.&#8221;
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a id="link_4"></a>BLOOD WILL TELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      David Greene was an employee of the Burdett Automatic Punch Company. The
      manufacturing plant of the company was at Bridgeport, but in the New York
      offices there were working samples of all the punches, from the little
      nickel-plated hand punch with which conductors squeezed holes in railroad
      tickets, to the big punch that could bite into an iron plate as easily as
      into a piece of pie. David&#8217;s duty was to explain these different
      punches, and accordingly when Burdett Senior or one of the sons turned a
      customer over to David he spoke of him as a salesman. But David called
      himself a &#8220;demonstrator.&#8221; For a short time he even succeeded
      in persuading the other salesmen to speak of themselves as demonstrators,
      but the shipping clerks and bookkeepers laughed them out of it. They could
      not laugh David out of it. This was so, partly because he had no sense of
      humor, and partly because he had a great-great-grandfather. Among the
      salesmen on lower Broadway, to possess a great-great-grandfather is
      unusual, even a great-grandfather is a rarity, and either is considered
      superfluous. But to David the possession of a great-great-grandfather was
      a precious and open delight. He had possessed him only for a short time.
      Undoubtedly he always had existed, but it was not until David&#8217;s
      sister Anne married a doctor in Bordentown, New Jersey, and became
      socially ambitious, that David emerged as a Son of Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sister Anne, anxious to &#8220;get in&#8221; as a &#8220;Daughter&#8221;
      and wear a distaff pin in her shirt-waist, who discovered the
      revolutionary ancestor. She unearthed him, or rather ran him to earth, in
      the graveyard of the Presbyterian church at Bordentown. He was no less a
      person than General Hiram Greene, and he had fought with Washington at
      Trenton and at Princeton. Of this there was no doubt. That, later, on
      moving to New York, his descendants became peace-loving salesmen did not
      affect his record. To enter a society founded on heredity, the important
      thing is first to catch your ancestor, and having made sure of him, David
      entered the Society of the Sons of Washington with flying colors. He was
      not unlike the man who had been speaking prose for forty years without
      knowing it. He was not unlike the other man who woke to find himself
      famous. He had gone to bed a timid, near-sighted, underpaid salesman
      without a relative in the world, except a married sister in Bordentown,
      and he awoke to find he was a direct descendant of &#8220;Neck or Nothing&#8221;
      Greene, a revolutionary hero, a friend of Washington, a man whose portrait
      hung in the State House at Trenton. David&#8217;s life had lacked color.
      The day he carried his certificate of membership to the big jewelry store
      uptown and purchased two rosettes, one for each of his two coats, was the
      proudest of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other men in the Broadway office took a different view. As Wyckoff,
      one of Burdett&#8217;s flying squadron of travelling salesmen, said,
      &#8220;All grandfathers look alike to me, whether they&#8217;re great, or
      great-great-great. Each one is as dead as the other. I&#8217;d rather have
      a live cousin who could loan me a five, or slip me a drink. What did your
      great-great dad ever do for <i>you</i>?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, for one thing,&#8221; said David stiffly, &#8220;he fought in
      the War of the Revolution. He saved us from the shackles of monarchical
      England; he made it possible for me and you to enjoy the liberties of a
      free republic.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to tell <i>me</i> your grandfather did all that,&#8221;
      protested Wyckoff, &#8220;because I know better. There were a lot of
      others helped. I read about it in a book.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am not grudging glory to others,&#8221; returned David; &#8220;I
      am only saying I am proud that I am a descendant of a revolutionist.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyckoff dived into his inner pocket and produced a leather photograph
      frame that folded like a concertina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a descendant,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;d
      rather be an ancestor. Look at those.&#8221; Proudly he exhibited
      photographs of Mrs. Wyckoff with the baby and of three other little
      Wyckoffs. David looked with envy at the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;When I&#8217;m married,&#8221; he stammered, and at the words he
      blushed, &#8220;I hope to be an ancestor.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you&#8217;re thinking of getting married,&#8221; said Wyckoff,
      &#8220;you&#8217;d better hope for a raise in salary.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other clerks were as unsympathetic as Wyckoff. At first when David
      showed them his parchment certificate, and his silver gilt insignia with
      on one side a portrait of Washington, and on the other a Continental
      soldier, they admitted it was dead swell. They even envied him, not the
      grandfather, but the fact that owing to that distinguished relative David
      was constantly receiving beautifully engraved invitations to attend the
      monthly meetings of the society; to subscribe to a fund to erect monuments
      on battle-fields to mark neglected graves; to join in joyous excursions to
      the tomb of Washington or of John Paul Jones; to inspect West Point,
      Annapolis, and Bunker Hill; to be among those present at the annual
      &#8220;banquet&#8221; at Delmonico&#8217;s. In order that when he opened
      these letters he might have an audience, he had given the society his
      office address.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these communications he was always addressed as &#8220;Dear Compatriot,&#8221;
      and never did the words fail to give him a thrill. They seemed to lift him
      out of Burdett&#8217;s salesrooms and Broadway, and place him next to
      things uncommercial, untainted, high, and noble. He did not quite know
      what an aristocrat was, but he believed being a compatriot made him an
      aristocrat. When customers were rude, when Mr. John or Mr. Robert was
      overbearing, this idea enabled David to rise above their ill-temper, and
      he would smile and say to himself: &#8220;If they knew the meaning of the
      blue rosette in my button-hole, how differently they would treat me! How
      easily with a word could I crush them!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But few of the customers recognized the significance of the button. They
      thought it meant that David belonged to the Y. M. C. A. or was a
      teetotaler. David, with his gentle manners and pale, ascetic face, was
      liable to give that impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Wyckoff mentioned marriage, the reason David blushed was because,
      although no one in the office suspected it, he wished to marry the person
      in whom the office took the greatest pride. This was Miss Emily Anthony,
      one of Burdett and Sons&#8217; youngest, most efficient, and prettiest
      stenographers, and although David did not cut as dashing a figure as did
      some of the firm&#8217;s travelling men, Miss Anthony had found something
      in him so greatly to admire that she had, out of office hours, accepted
      his devotion, his theatre tickets, and an engagement ring. Indeed, so far
      had matters progressed, that it had been almost decided when in a few
      months they would go upon their vacations they also would go upon their
      honeymoon. And then a cloud had come between them, and from a quarter from
      which David had expected only sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble befell when David discovered he had a great-great-grandfather.
      With that fact itself Miss Anthony was almost as pleased as was David
      himself, but while he was content to bask in another&#8217;s glory, Miss
      Anthony saw in his inheritance only an incentive to achieve glory for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a hard-working salesman she had asked but little, but from a
      descendant of a national hero she expected other things. She was a
      determined young person, and for David she was an ambitious young person.
      She found she was dissatisfied. She found she was disappointed. The
      great-great-grandfather had opened up a new horizon&#8211;had, in a way,
      raised the standard. She was as fond of David as always, but his tales of
      past wars and battles, his accounts of present banquets at which he sat
      shoulder to shoulder with men of whom even Burdett and Sons spoke with
      awe, touched her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be content to just wear a button,&#8221; she
      urged. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a Son of Washington, you ought to act like
      one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know I&#8217;m not worthy of you,&#8221; David sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that, and you know I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Emily
      replied indignantly. &#8220;It has nothing to do with me! I want you to be
      worthy of yourself, of your grandpa Hiram!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But <i>how</i>?&#8221; complained David. &#8220;What chance has a
      twenty-five dollar a week clerk&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a year before the Spanish-American War, while the patriots of Cuba
      were fighting the mother country for their independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If I were a Son of the Revolution,&#8221; said Emily, &#8220;I&#8217;d
      go to Cuba and help free it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense,&#8221; cried David. &#8220;If I did that
      I&#8217;d lose my job, and we&#8217;d never be able to marry. Besides,
      what&#8217;s Cuba done for me? All I know about Cuba is, I once smoked a
      Cuban cigar and it made me ill.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did Lafayette talk like that?&#8221; demanded Emily. &#8220;Did he
      ask what have the American rebels ever done for me?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If I were in Lafayette&#8217;s class,&#8221; sighed David, &#8220;I
      wouldn&#8217;t be selling automatic punches.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s your trouble,&#8221; declared Emily. &#8220;You lack
      self-confidence. You&#8217;re too humble, you&#8217;ve got fighting blood
      and you ought to keep saying to yourself, &#8216;Blood will tell,&#8217;
      and the first thing you know, it <i>will</i> tell! You might begin by
      going into politics in your ward. Or, you could join the militia. That
      takes only one night a week, and then, if we <i>did</i> go to war with
      Spain, you&#8217;d get a commission, and come back a captain!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily&#8217;s eyes were beautiful with delight. But the sight gave David
      no pleasure. In genuine distress, he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Emily,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to be awfully
      disappointed in me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily&#8217;s eyes closed as though they shied at some mental picture. But
      when she opened them they were bright, and her smile was kind and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she protested; &#8220;only I want a
      husband with a career, and one who&#8217;ll tell me to keep quiet when I
      try to run it for him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve often wished you would,&#8221; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Would what? Run your career for you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, keep quiet. Only it didn&#8217;t seem polite to tell you so.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d like you better,&#8221; said Emily, &#8220;if you
      weren&#8217;t so darned polite.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, early in the spring of 1897, the unexpected happened, and
      David was promoted into the flying squadron. He now was a travelling
      salesman, with a rise in salary and a commission on orders. It was a step
      forward, but as going on the road meant absence from Emily, David was not
      elated. Nor did it satisfy Emily. It was not money she wanted. Her
      ambition for David could not be silenced with a raise in wages. She did
      not say this, but David knew that in him she still found something
      lacking, and when they said good-by they both were ill at ease and
      completely unhappy. Formerly, each day when Emily in passing David in the
      office said good-morning, she used to add the number of the days that
      still separated them from the vacation which also was to be their
      honeymoon. But, for the last month she had stopped counting the days&#8211;at
      least she did not count them aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      David did not ask her why this was so. He did not dare. And, sooner than
      learn the truth that she had decided not to marry him, or that she was
      even considering not marrying him, he asked no questions, but in ignorance
      of her present feelings set forth on his travels. Absence from Emily hurt
      just as much as he had feared it would. He missed her, needed her, longed
      for her. In numerous letters he told her so. But, owing to the frequency
      with which he moved, her letters never caught up with him. It was almost a
      relief. He did not care to think of what they might tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route assigned David took him through the South and kept him close to
      the Atlantic seaboard. In obtaining orders he was not unsuccessful, and at
      the end of the first month received from the firm a telegram of
      congratulation. This was of importance chiefly because it might please
      Emily. But he knew that in her eyes the great-great-grandson of Hiram
      Greene could not rest content with a telegram from Burdett and Sons. A
      year before she would have considered it a high honor, a cause for
      celebration. Now, he could see her press her pretty lips together and
      shake her pretty head. It was not enough. But how could he accomplish
      more. He began to hate his great-great-grandfather. He began to wish Hiram
      Greene had lived and died a bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Dame Fortune took David in hand and toyed with him and spanked
      him, and pelted and petted him, until finally she made him her favorite
      son. Dame Fortune went about this work in an abrupt and arbitrary manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the 1st of March, 1897, two trains were scheduled to leave
      the Union Station at Jacksonville at exactly the same minute, and they
      left exactly on time. As never before in the history of any Southern
      railroad has this miracle occurred, it shows that when Dame Fortune gets
      on the job she is omnipotent. She placed David on the train to Miami as
      the train he wanted drew out for Tampa, and an hour later, when the
      conductor looked at David&#8217;s ticket, he pulled the bell-cord and
      dumped David over the side into the heart of a pine forest. If he walked
      back along the track for one mile, the conductor reassured him, he would
      find a flag station where at midnight he could flag a train going north.
      In an hour it would deliver him safely in Jacksonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moon, but for the greater part of the time it was hidden by
      fitful, hurrying clouds, and, as David stumbled forward, at one moment he
      would see the rails like streaks of silver, and the next would be
      encompassed in a complete and bewildering darkness. He made his way from
      tie to tie only by feeling with his foot. After an hour he came to a shed.
      Whether it was or was not the flag station the conductor had in mind, he
      did not know, and he never did know. He was too tired, too hot, and too
      disgusted to proceed, and dropping his suit case he sat down under the
      open roof of the shed prepared to wait either for the train or daylight.
      So far as he could see, on every side of him stretched a swamp, silent,
      dismal, interminable. From its black water rose dead trees, naked of bark
      and hung with streamers of funereal moss. There was not a sound or sign of
      human habitation. The silence was the silence of the ocean at night. David
      remembered the berth reserved for him on the train to Tampa and of the
      loathing with which he had considered placing himself between its sheets.
      But now how gladly would he welcome it! For, in the sleeping-car,
      ill-smelling, close and stuffy, he at least would have been surrounded by
      fellow-sufferers of his own species. Here his companions were owls,
      water-snakes, and sleeping buzzards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am alone,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;on a railroad
      embankment, entirely surrounded by alligators.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he found he was not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness, illuminated by a match, not a hundred yards from him
      there flashed suddenly the face of a man. Then the match went out and the
      face with it. David noted that it had appeared at some height above the
      level of the swamp, at an elevation higher even than that of the
      embankment. It was as though the man had been sitting on the limb of a
      tree. David crossed the tracks and found that on the side of the
      embankment opposite the shed there was solid ground and what once had been
      a wharf. He advanced over this cautiously, and as he did so the clouds
      disappeared, and in the full light of the moon he saw a bayou broadening
      into a river, and made fast to the decayed and rotting wharf an
      ocean-going tug. It was from her deck that the man, in lighting his pipe,
      had shown his face. At the thought of a warm engine-room and the company
      of his fellow-creatures, David&#8217;s heart leaped with pleasure. He
      advanced quickly. And then something in the appearance of the tug,
      something mysterious, secretive, threatening, caused him to halt. No
      lights showed from her engine-room, cabin, or pilot-house. Her decks were
      empty. But, as was evidenced by the black smoke that rose from her funnel,
      she was awake and awake to some purpose. David stood uncertainly,
      questioning whether to make his presence known or return to the loneliness
      of the shed. The question was decided for him. He had not considered that
      standing in the moonlight he was a conspicuous figure. The planks of the
      wharf creaked and a man came toward him. As one who means to attack, or
      who fears attack, he approached warily. He wore high boots, riding
      breeches, and a sombrero. He was a little man, but his movements were
      alert and active. To David he seemed unnecessarily excited. He thrust
      himself close against David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who the devil are you?&#8221; demanded the man from the tug.
      &#8220;How&#8217;d you get here?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I walked,&#8221; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Walked?&#8221; the man snorted incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I took the wrong train,&#8221; explained David pleasantly. &#8220;They
      put me off about a mile below here. I walked back to this flag station. I&#8217;m
      going to wait here for the next train north.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man laughed mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no you&#8217;re not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you walked here,
      you can just walk away again!&#8221; With a sweep of his arm, he made a
      vigorous and peremptory gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You walk!&#8221; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll do just as I please about that,&#8221; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though to bring assistance, the little man started hastily toward the
      tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll find some one who&#8217;ll make you walk!&#8221; he
      called. &#8220;You <i>wait</i>, that&#8217;s all, you <i>wait</i>!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David decided not to wait. It was possible the wharf was private property
      and he had been trespassing. In any case, at the flag station the rights
      of all men were equal, and if he were in for a fight he judged it best to
      choose his own battleground. He recrossed the tracks and sat down on his
      suit case in a dark corner of the shed. Himself hidden in the shadows he
      could see in the moonlight the approach of any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They&#8217;re river pirates,&#8221; said David to himself, &#8220;or
      smugglers. They&#8217;re certainly up to some mischief, or why should they
      object to the presence of a perfectly harmless stranger?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly with cold, partly with nervousness, David shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish that train would come,&#8221; he sighed. And instantly, as
      though in answer to his wish, from only a short distance down the track he
      heard the rumble and creak of approaching cars. In a flash David planned
      his course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of spending the night in a swamp infested by alligators and
      smugglers had become intolerable. He must escape, and he must escape by
      the train now approaching. To that end the train must be stopped. His plan
      was simple. The train was moving very, very slowly, and though he had no
      lantern to wave, in order to bring it to a halt he need only stand on the
      track exposed to the glare of the headlight and wave his arms. David
      sprang between the rails and gesticulated wildly. But in amazement his
      arms fell to his sides. For the train, now only a hundred yards distant
      and creeping toward him at a snail&#8217;s pace, carried no headlight, and
      though in the moonlight David was plainly visible, it blew no whistle,
      tolled no bell. Even the passenger coaches in the rear of the sightless
      engine were wrapped in darkness. It was a ghost of a train, a Flying
      Dutchman of a train, a nightmare of a train. It was as unreal as the black
      swamp, as the moss on the dead trees, as the ghostly tug-boat tied to the
      rotting wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is the place haunted!&#8221; exclaimed David.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by the grinding of brakes and by the train coming to a
      sharp halt. And instantly from every side men fell from it to the ground,
      and the silence of the night was broken by a confusion of calls and eager
      greeting and questions and sharp words of command.
    </p>
    <p>
      So fascinated was David in the stealthy arrival of the train and in her
      mysterious passengers that, until they confronted him, he did not note the
      equally stealthy approach of three men. Of these one was the little man
      from the tug. With him was a fat, red-faced Irish-American. He wore no
      coat and his shirt-sleeves were drawn away from his hands by garters of
      pink elastic, his derby hat was balanced behind his ears, upon his right
      hand flashed an enormous diamond. He looked as though but at that moment
      he had stopped sliding glasses across a Bowery bar. The third man carried
      the outward marks of a sailor. David believed he was the tallest man he
      had ever beheld, but equally remarkable with his height was his beard and
      hair, which were of a fierce brick-dust red. Even in the mild moonlight it
      flamed like a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s your business?&#8221; demanded the man with the
      flamboyant hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I came here,&#8221; began David, &#8220;to wait for a train&#8213;-&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man bellowed with indignant rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;this is the sort of place any one
      would pick out to wait for a train!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of David&#8217;s nose he shook a fist as large as a catcher&#8217;s
      glove. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you lie to <i>me</i>!&#8221; he bullied. &#8220;Do
      you know who I am? Do you know <i>who</i> you&#8217;re up against? I&#8217;m&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barkeeper person interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind who you are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know that. Find
      out who <i>he</i> is.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David turned appealingly to the barkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d come here on purpose?&#8221; he protested.
      &#8220;I&#8217;m a travelling man&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You won&#8217;t travel any to-night,&#8221; mocked the red-haired
      one. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen what you came to see, and all you want now
      is to get to a Western Union wire. Well, you don&#8217;t do it. You don&#8217;t
      leave here to-night!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      As though he thought he had been neglected, the little man in riding-boots
      pushed forward importantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Tie him to a tree!&#8221; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Better take him on board,&#8221; said the barkeeper, &#8220;and
      send him back by the pilot. When we&#8217;re once at sea, he can&#8217;t
      hurt us any.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What makes you think I want to hurt you?&#8221; demanded David.
      &#8220;Who do you think I am?&#8221;
    </p>

    <!--  figure -->
    <p>
      &#8220;We know who you are,&#8221; shouted the fiery-headed one. &#8220;You&#8217;re
      a blanketty-blank spy! You&#8217;re a government spy or a Spanish spy, and
      whichever you are you don&#8217;t get away to-night!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David had not the faintest idea what the man meant, but he knew his
      self-respect was being ill-treated, and his self-respect rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You have made a very serious mistake,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
      whether you like it or not, I <i>am</i> leaving here to-night, and <i>you</i>
      can go to the devil!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his back David started with great dignity to walk away. It was a
      short walk. Something hit him below the ear and he found himself curling
      up comfortably on the ties. He had a strong desire to sleep, but was
      conscious that a bed on a railroad track, on account of trains wanting to
      pass, was unsafe. This doubt did not long disturb him. His head rolled
      against the steel rail, his limbs relaxed. From a great distance, and in a
      strange sing-song he heard the voice of the barkeeper saying, &#8220;Nine&#8211;ten&#8211;and
      <i>out</i>!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When David came to his senses his head was resting on a coil of rope. In
      his ears was the steady throb of an engine, and in his eyes the glare of a
      lantern. The lantern was held by a pleasant-faced youth in a golf cap who
      was smiling sympathetically. David rose on his elbow and gazed wildly
      about him. He was in the bow of the ocean-going tug, and he saw that from
      where he lay in the bow to her stern her decks were packed with men. She
      was steaming swiftly down a broad river. On either side the gray light
      that comes before the dawn showed low banks studded with stunted
      palmettos. Close ahead David heard the roar of the surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sorry to disturb you,&#8221; said the youth in the golf cap,
      &#8220;but we drop the pilot in a few minutes and you&#8217;re going with
      him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David moved his aching head gingerly, and was conscious of a bump as large
      as a tennis ball behind his right ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What happened to me?&#8221; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You were sort of kidnapped, I guess,&#8221; laughed the young man.
      &#8220;It was a raw deal, but they couldn&#8217;t take any chances. The
      pilot will land you at Okra Point. You can hire a rig there to take you to
      the railroad.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But why?&#8221; demanded David indignantly. &#8220;Why was I
      kidnapped? What had I done? Who were those men who&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the pilot-house there was a sharp jangle of bells to the engine-room,
      and the speed of the tug slackened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come on,&#8221; commanded the young man briskly. &#8220;The pilot&#8217;s
      going ashore. Here&#8217;s your grip, here&#8217;s your hat. The ladder&#8217;s
      on the port side. Look where you&#8217;re stepping. We can&#8217;t show
      any lights, and it&#8217;s dark as&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even as he spoke, like a flash of powder, as swiftly as one throws an
      electric switch, as blindingly as a train leaps from the tunnel into the
      glaring sun, the darkness vanished and the tug was swept by the fierce,
      blatant radiance of a search-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was met by shrieks from two hundred throats, by screams, oaths,
      prayers, by the sharp jangling of bells, by the blind rush of many men
      scurrying like rats for a hole to hide in, by the ringing orders of one
      man. Above the tumult this one voice rose like the warning strokes of a
      fire-gong, and looking up to the pilot-house from whence the voice came,
      David saw the barkeeper still in his shirt-sleeves and with his derby hat
      pushed back behind his ears, with one hand clutching the telegraph to the
      engine-room, with the other holding the spoke of the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      David felt the tug, like a hunter taking a fence, rise in a great leap.
      Her bow sank and rose, tossing the water from her in black, oily waves,
      the smoke poured from her funnel, from below her engines sobbed and
      quivered, and like a hound freed from a leash she raced for the open sea.
      But swiftly as she fled, as a thief is held in the circle of a policeman&#8217;s
      bull&#8217;s-eye, the shaft of light followed and exposed her and held her
      in its grip. The youth in the golf cap was clutching David by the arm.
      With his free hand he pointed down the shaft of light. So great was the
      tumult that to be heard he brought his lips close to David&#8217;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s the revenue cutter!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;She&#8217;s
      been laying for us for three weeks, and now,&#8221; he shrieked
      exultingly, &#8220;the old man&#8217;s going to give her a race for it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      From excitement, from cold, from alarm, David&#8217;s nerves were getting
      beyond his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But how,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;how do I get ashore?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;When he drops the pilot, don&#8217;t I&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How can he drop the pilot?&#8221; yelled the youth. &#8220;The
      pilot&#8217;s got to stick by the boat. So have you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David clutched the young man and swung him so that they stood face to
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stick by what boat?&#8221; yelled David. &#8220;Who are these men?
      Who are you? What boat is this?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the glare of the search-light David saw the eyes of the youth staring
      at him as though he feared he were in the clutch of a madman. Wrenching
      himself free, the youth pointed at the pilot-house. Above it on a blue
      board in letters of gold-leaf a foot high was the name of the tug. As
      David read it his breath left him, a finger of ice passed slowly down his
      spine. The name he read was <i>The Three Friends</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;<i>The Three Friends!</i>&#8221; shrieked David. &#8220;She&#8217;s
      a filibuster! She&#8217;s a pirate! Where&#8217;re we going?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To Cuba!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David emitted a howl of anguish, rage, and protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What for?&#8221; he shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man regarded him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To pick bananas,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I won&#8217;t go to Cuba,&#8221; shouted David. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
      got to work! I&#8217;m paid to sell machinery. I demand to be put ashore.
      I&#8217;ll lose my job if I&#8217;m not put ashore. I&#8217;ll sue you! I&#8217;ll
      have the law&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David found himself suddenly upon his knees. His first thought was that
      the ship had struck a rock, and then that she was bumping herself over a
      succession of coral reefs. She dipped, dived, reared, and plunged. Like a
      hooked fish, she flung herself in the air, quivering from bow to stern. No
      longer was David of a mind to sue the filibusters if they did not put him
      ashore. If only they had put him ashore, in gratitude he would have
      crawled on his knees. What followed was of no interest to David, nor to
      many of the filibusters, nor to any of the Cuban patriots. Their groans of
      self-pity, their prayers and curses in eloquent Spanish, rose high above
      the crash of broken crockery and the pounding of the waves. Even when the
      search-light gave way to a brilliant sunlight the circumstance was
      unobserved by David. Nor was he concerned in the tidings brought forward
      by the youth in the golf cap, who raced the slippery decks and vaulted the
      prostrate forms as sure-footedly as a hurdler on a cinder track. To David,
      in whom he seemed to think he had found a congenial spirit, he shouted
      joyfully, &#8220;She&#8217;s fired two blanks at us!&#8221; he cried;
      &#8220;now she&#8217;s firing cannon-balls!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank God,&#8221; whispered David; &#8220;perhaps she&#8217;ll sink
      us!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But <i>The Three Friends</i> showed her heels to the revenue cutter, and
      so far as David knew hours passed into days and days into weeks. It was
      like those nightmares in which in a minute one is whirled through
      centuries of fear and torment. Sometimes, regardless of nausea, of his
      aching head, of the hard deck, of the waves that splashed and smothered
      him, David fell into broken slumber. Sometimes he woke to a dull
      consciousness of his position. At such moments he added to his misery by
      speculating upon the other misfortunes that might have befallen him on
      shore. Emily, he decided, had given him up for lost and married&#8211;probably
      a navy officer in command of a battle-ship. Burdett and Sons had cast him
      off forever. Possibly his disappearance had caused them to suspect him;
      even now they might be regarding him as a defaulter, as a fugitive from
      justice. His accounts, no doubt, were being carefully overhauled. In
      actual time, two days and two nights had passed; to David it seemed many
      ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day he crawled to the stern, where there seemed less motion,
      and finding a boat&#8217;s cushion threw it in the lee scupper and fell
      upon it. From time to time the youth in the golf cap had brought him food
      and drink, and he now appeared from the cook&#8217;s galley bearing a bowl
      of smoking soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      David considered it a doubtful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re very kind. How did a fellow like you come
      to mix up with these pirates?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth laughed good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They&#8217;re not pirates, they&#8217;re patriots,&#8221; he said,
      &#8220;and I&#8217;m not mixed up with them. My name is Henry Carr and I&#8217;m
      a guest of Jimmy Doyle, the captain.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The barkeeper with the derby hat?&#8221; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not a barkeeper, he&#8217;s a teetotaler,&#8221; Carr
      corrected, &#8220;and he&#8217;s the greatest filibuster alive. He knows
      these waters as you know Broadway, and he&#8217;s the salt of the earth. I
      did him a favor once; sort of mouse-helping-the-lion idea. Just through
      dumb luck I found out about this expedition. The government agents in New
      York found out I&#8217;d found out and sent for me to tell. But I didn&#8217;t,
      and I didn&#8217;t write the story either. Doyle heard about that. So, he
      asked me to come as his guest, and he&#8217;s promised that after he&#8217;s
      landed the expedition and the arms I can write as much about it as I darn
      please.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then you&#8217;re a reporter?&#8221; said David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m what we call a cub reporter,&#8221; laughed Carr. &#8220;You
      see, I&#8217;ve always dreamed of being a war correspondent. The men in
      the office say I dream too much. They&#8217;re always guying me about it.
      But, haven&#8217;t you noticed, it&#8217;s the ones who dream who find
      their dreams come true. Now this isn&#8217;t real war, but it&#8217;s a
      near war, and when the real thing breaks loose, I can tell the managing
      editor I served as a war correspondent in the Cuban-Spanish campaign. And
      he may give me a real job!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And you <i>like</i> this?&#8221; groaned David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, if I were as sick as you are,&#8221; said Carr,
      &#8220;but I&#8217;ve a stomach like a Harlem goat.&#8221; He stooped and
      lowered his voice. &#8220;Now, here are two fake filibusters,&#8221; he
      whispered. &#8220;The men you read about in the newspapers. If a man&#8217;s
      a <i>real</i> filibuster, nobody knows it!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming toward them was the tall man who had knocked David out, and the
      little one who had wanted to tie him to a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All they ask,&#8221; whispered Carr, &#8220;is money and
      advertisement. If they knew I was a reporter, they&#8217;d eat out of my
      hand. The tall man calls himself Lighthouse Harry. He once kept a
      lighthouse on the Florida coast, and that&#8217;s as near to the sea as he
      ever got. The other one is a daredevil calling himself Colonel Beamish. He
      says he&#8217;s an English officer, and a soldier of fortune, and that he&#8217;s
      been in eighteen battles. Jimmy says he&#8217;s never been near enough to
      a battle to see the red-cross flags on the base hospital. But they&#8217;ve
      fooled these Cubans. The Junta thinks they&#8217;re great fighters, and it&#8217;s
      sent them down here to work the machine guns. But I&#8217;m afraid the
      only fighting they will do will be in the sporting columns, and not in the
      ring.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A half dozen sea-sick Cubans were carrying a heavy, oblong box. They
      dropped it not two yards from where David lay, and with a screw-driver
      Lighthouse Harry proceeded to open the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carr explained to David that <i>The Three Friends</i> was approaching that
      part of the coast of Cuba on which she had arranged to land her
      expedition, and that in case she was surprised by one of the Spanish
      patrol boats she was preparing to defend herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They&#8217;ve got an automatic gun in that crate,&#8221; said Carr,
      &#8220;and they&#8217;re going to assemble it. You&#8217;d better move;
      they&#8217;ll be tramping all over you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David shook his head feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t move!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
      move if it would free Cuba.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      For several hours with very languid interest David watched Lighthouse
      Harry and Colonel Beamish screw a heavy tripod to the deck and balance
      above it a quick-firing one-pounder. They worked very slowly, and to
      David, watching them from the lee scupper, they appeared extremely
      unintelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe either of those thugs put an automatic gun
      together in his life,&#8221; he whispered to Carr. &#8220;I never did,
      either, but I&#8217;ve put hundreds of automatic punches together, and I
      bet that gun won&#8217;t work.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with it?&#8221; said Carr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before David could summon sufficient energy to answer, the attention of
      all on board was diverted, and by a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the word is whispered apologetically by the smoking-room steward
      to those deep in bridge, or shrieked from the tops of a sinking ship it
      never quite fails of its effect. A sweating stoker from the engine-room
      saw it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Land!&#8221; he hailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea-sick Cubans raised themselves and swung their hats; their voices
      rose in a fierce chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Cuba libre!&#8221; they yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun piercing the morning mists had uncovered a coast-line broken with
      bays and inlets. Above it towered green hills, the peak of each topped by
      a squat block-house; in the valleys and water courses like columns of
      marble rose the royal palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You <i>must</i> look!&#8221; Carr entreated David. &#8220;It&#8217;s
      just as it is in the pictures!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then I don&#8217;t have to look,&#8221; groaned David.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Three Friends</i> was making for a point of land that curved like a
      sickle. On the inside of the sickle was Nipe Bay. On the opposite shore of
      that broad harbor at the place of rendezvous a little band of Cubans
      waited to receive the filibusters. The goal was in sight. The dreadful
      voyage was done. Joy and excitement thrilled the ship&#8217;s company.
      Cuban patriots appeared in uniforms with Cuban flags pinned in the brims
      of their straw sombreros. From the hold came boxes of small-arm
      ammunition, of Mausers, rifles, machetes, and saddles. To protect the
      landing a box of shells was placed in readiness beside the one-pounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In two hours, if we have smooth water,&#8221; shouted Lighthouse
      Harry, &#8220;we ought to get all of this on shore. And then, all I ask,&#8221;
      he cried mightily, &#8220;is for some one to kindly show me a Spaniard!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart&#8217;s desire was instantly granted. He was shown not only one
      Spaniard, but several Spaniards. They were on the deck of one of the
      fastest gun-boats of the Spanish navy. Not a mile from <i>The Three
      Friends</i> she sprang from the cover of a narrow inlet. She did not
      signal questions or extend courtesies. For her the name of the ocean-going
      tug was sufficient introduction. Throwing ahead of her a solid shell, she
      raced in pursuit, and as <i>The Three Friends</i> leaped to full speed
      there came from the gun-boat the sharp dry crackle of Mausers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an explosion of terrifying oaths Lighthouse Harry thrust a shell into
      the breech of the quick-firing gun. Without waiting to aim it, he tugged
      at the trigger. Nothing happened! He threw open the breech and gazed
      impotently at the base of the shell. It was untouched. The ship was
      ringing with cries of anger, of hate, with rat-like squeaks of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the heads of the filibusters a shell screamed and within a hundred
      feet splashed into a wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his mat in the lee scupper David groaned miserably. He was far
      removed from any of the greater emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s no use!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;They can&#8217;t do!
      It&#8217;s not connected!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;<i>What&#8217;s</i> not connected?&#8221; yelled Carr. He fell upon
      David. He half-lifted, half-dragged him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you know what&#8217;s wrong with that gun, you fix it! Fix it,&#8221;
      he shouted, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      David was not concerned with the vengeance Carr threatened. For, on the
      instant a miracle had taken place. With the swift insidiousness of
      morphine, peace ran through his veins, soothed his racked body, his
      jangled nerves. <i>The Three Friends</i> had made the harbor, and was
      gliding through water flat as a pond. But David did not know why the
      change had come. He knew only that his soul and body were at rest, that
      the sun was shining, that he had passed through the valley of the shadow,
      and once more was a sane, sound young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a savage thrust of the shoulder he sent Lighthouse Harry sprawling
      from the gun. With swift, practised fingers he fell upon its mechanism. He
      wrenched it apart. He lifted it, reset, readjusted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant themselves, those about him saw that he understood, saw that his
      work was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      They raised a joyous, defiant cheer. But a shower of bullets drove them to
      cover, bullets that ripped the deck, splintered the superstructure,
      smashed the glass in the air ports, like angry wasps sang in a continuous
      whining chorus. Intent only on the gun, David worked feverishly. He swung
      to the breech, locked it, and dragged it open, pulled on the trigger and
      found it gave before his forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shouted with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it working,&#8221; he yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his audience, but his audience had fled. From beneath one of
      the life-boats protruded the riding-boots of Colonel Beamish, the tall
      form of Lighthouse Harry was doubled behind a water butt. A shell splashed
      to port, a shell splashed to starboard. For an instant David stood staring
      wide-eyed at the greyhound of a boat that ate up the distance between
      them, at the jets of smoke and stabs of flame that sprang from her bow, at
      the figures crouched behind her gunwale, firing in volleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      To David it came suddenly, convincingly, that in a dream he had lived it
      all before, and something like raw poison stirred in David, something
      leaped to his throat and choked him, something rose in his brain and made
      him see scarlet. He felt rather than saw young Carr kneeling at the box of
      ammunition, and holding a shell toward him. He heard the click as the
      breech shut, felt the rubber tire of the brace give against the weight of
      his shoulder, down a long shining tube saw the pursuing gun-boat, saw her
      again and many times disappear behind a flash of flame. A bullet gashed
      his forehead, a bullet passed deftly through his forearm, but he did not
      heed them. Confused with the thrashing of the engines, with the roar of
      the gun he heard a strange voice shrieking unceasingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Cuba libre!&#8221; it yelled. &#8220;To hell with Spain!&#8221; and
      he found that the voice was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story lost nothing in the way Carr wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And the best of it is,&#8221; he exclaimed joyfully, &#8220;it&#8217;s
      true!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a Spanish gun-boat <i>had</i> been crippled and forced to run herself
      aground by a tug-boat manned by Cuban patriots, and by a single gun served
      by one man, and that man an American. It was the first sea-fight of the
      war. Over night a Cuban navy had been born, and into the limelight a cub
      reporter had projected a new &#8220;hero,&#8221; a ready-made,
      warranted-not-to-run, popular idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated in the pilot-house, &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Doyle, Carr, and
      David, the patriots and their arms had been safely dumped upon the coast
      of Cuba, and <i>The</i> <i>Three Friends</i> was gliding swiftly and,
      having caught the Florida straits napping, smoothly toward Key West. Carr
      had just finished reading aloud his account of the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You will tell the story just as I have written it,&#8221; commanded
      the proud author. &#8220;Your being South as a travelling salesman was
      only a blind. You came to volunteer for this expedition. Before you could
      explain your wish you were mistaken for a secret-service man, and hustled
      on board. That was just where you wanted to be, and when the moment
      arrived you took command of the ship and single-handed won the naval
      battle of Nipe Bay.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Doyle nodded his head approvingly. &#8220;You certainly did, Dave,&#8221;
      protested the great man, &#8220;I seen you when you done it!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Key West Carr filed his story and while the hospital surgeons kept
      David there over one steamer, to dress his wounds, his fame and features
      spread across the map of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burdett and Sons basked in reflected glory. Reporters besieged their
      office. At the Merchants Down-Town Club the business men of lower Broadway
      tendered congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s a great surprise to us,&#8221; Burdett and
      Sons would protest and wink heavily. &#8220;Of course, when the boy asked
      to be sent South we&#8217;d no idea he was planning to fight for Cuba! Or
      we wouldn&#8217;t have let him go, would we?&#8221; Then again they would
      wink heavily. &#8220;I suppose you know,&#8221; they would say, &#8220;that
      he&#8217;s a direct descendant of General Hiram Greene, who won the battle
      of Trenton. What I say is, &#8216;Blood will tell!&#8217;&#8221; And then
      in a body every one in the club would move against the bar and exclaim:
      &#8220;Here&#8217;s to Cuba libre!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <i>Olivette</i> from Key West reached Tampa Bay every Cuban in
      the Tampa cigar factories was at the dock. There were thousands of them
      and all of the Junta, in high hats, to read David an address of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when they saw him at the top of the gang-plank with his head in a
      bandage and his arm in a sling, like a mob of maniacs they howled and
      surged toward him. But before they could reach their hero the courteous
      Junta forced them back, and cleared a pathway for a young girl. She was
      travel-worn and pale, her shirt-waist was disgracefully wrinkled, her best
      hat was a wreck. No one on Broadway would have recognized her as Burdett
      and Sons&#8217; most immaculate and beautiful stenographer.

        When this story first appeared, the writer received letters of two
        kinds, one asking a question and the other making a statement. The
        question was, whether there was any foundation of truth in the story;
        the statement challenged him to say that there was. The letters seemed
        to show that a large proportion of readers prefer their dose of fiction
        with a sweetening of fact. This is written to furnish that condiment,
        and to answer the question and the statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dog world, the original of the bull-terrier in the story is known
        as Edgewood Cold Steel and to his intimates as &#8220;Kid.&#8221; His
        father was Lord Minto, a thoroughbred bull-terrier, well known in
        Canada, but the story of Kid&#8217;s life is that his mother was a
        black-and-tan named Vic. She was a lady of doubtful pedigree. Among her
        offspring by Lord Minto, so I have been often informed by many Canadian
        dog-fanciers, breeders, and exhibitors, was the only white puppy, Kid,
        in a litter of black-and-tans. He made his first appearance in the show
        world in 1900 in Toronto, where, under the judging of Mr. Charles H.
        Mason, he was easily first. During that year, when he came to our
        kennels, and in the two years following, he carried off many blue
        ribbons and cups at nearly every first-class show in the country. The
        other dog, &#8220;Jimmy Jocks,&#8221; who in the book was his friend and
        mentor, was in real life his friend and companion, Woodcote Jumbo, or
        &#8220;Jaggers,&#8221; an aristocratic son of a long line of English
        champions. He has gone to that place where some day all good dogs must
        go.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this autobiography I have tried to describe Kid as he really is, and
        this year, when he again strives for blue ribbons, I trust, should the
        gentle reader see him at any of the bench-shows, he will give him a
        friendly pat and make his acquaintance. He will find his advances met
        with a polite and gentle courtesy.

      PART I
    </p>
    <p class="tiz">
      The Master was walking most unsteady, his legs tripping each other. After
      the fifth or sixth round, my legs often go the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even when the Master&#8217;s legs bend and twist a bit, you mustn&#8217;t
      think he can&#8217;t reach you. Indeed, that is the time he kicks most
      frequent. So I kept behind him in the shadow, or ran in the middle of the
      street. He stopped at many public houses with swinging doors, those doors
      that are cut so high from the sidewalk that you can look in under them,
      and see if the Master is inside. At night, when I peep beneath them, the
      man at the counter will see me first and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the Kid,
      Jerry, come to take you home. Get a move on you&#8221;; and the Master
      will stumble out and follow me. It&#8217;s lucky for us I&#8217;m so
      white, for, no matter how dark the night, he can always see me ahead, just
      out of reach of his boot. At night the Master certainly does see most
      amazing. Sometimes he sees two or four of me, and walks in a circle, so
      that I have to take him by the leg of his trousers and lead him into the
      right road. One night, when he was very nasty-tempered and I was coaxing
      him along, two men passed us, and one of them says, &#8220;Look at that
      brute!&#8221; and the other asks, &#8220;Which?&#8221; and they both
      laugh. The Master he cursed them good and proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this night, whenever we stopped at a public house, the Master&#8217;s
      pals left it and went on with us to the next. They spoke quite civil to
      me, and when the Master tried a flying kick, they gives him a shove.
      &#8220;Do you want us to lose our money?&#8221; says the pals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had nothing to eat for a day and a night, and just before we set out
      the Master gives me a wash under the hydrant. Whenever I am locked up
      until all the slop-pans in our alley are empty, and made to take a bath,
      and the Master&#8217;s pals speak civil and feel my ribs, I know something
      is going to happen. And that night, when every time they see a policeman
      under a lamp-post, they dodged across the street, and when at the last one
      of them picked me up and hid me under his jacket, I began to tremble; for
      I knew what it meant. It meant that I was to fight again for the Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&#8217;t fight because I like fighting. I fight because if I didn&#8217;t
      the other dog would find my throat, and the Master would lose his stakes,
      and I would be very sorry for him, and ashamed. Dogs can pass me and I can
      pass dogs, and I&#8217;d never pick a fight with none of them. When I see
      two dogs standing on their hind legs in the streets, clawing each other&#8217;s
      ears, and snapping for each other&#8217;s wind-pipes, or howling and
      swearing and rolling in the mud, I feel sorry they should act so, and
      pretend not to notice. If he&#8217;d let me, I&#8217;d like to pass the
      time of day with every dog I meet. But there&#8217;s something about me
      that no nice dog can abide. When I trot up to nice dogs, nodding and
      grinning, to make friends, they always tell me to be off. &#8220;Go to the
      devil!&#8221; they bark at me. &#8220;Get out!&#8221; And when I walk away
      they shout &#8220;Mongrel!&#8221; and &#8220;Gutter-dog!&#8221; and
      sometimes, after my back is turned, they rush me. I could kill most of
      them with three shakes, breaking the backbone of the little ones and
      squeezing the throat of the big ones. But what&#8217;s the good? They <i>are</i>
      nice dogs; that&#8217;s why I try to make up to them: and, though it&#8217;s
      not for them to say it, I <i>am</i> a street-dog, and if I try to push
      into the company of my betters, I suppose it&#8217;s their right to teach
      me my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m the best fighting bull-terrier
      of my weight in Montreal. That&#8217;s why it wouldn&#8217;t be fair for
      me to take notice of what they shout. They don&#8217;t know that if I once
      locked my jaws on them I&#8217;d carry away whatever I touched. The night
      I fought Kelley&#8217;s White Rat, I wouldn&#8217;t loosen up until the
      Master made a noose in my leash and strangled me; and, as for that Ottawa
      dog, if the handlers hadn&#8217;t thrown red pepper down my nose I <i>never</i>
      would have let go of him. I don&#8217;t think the handlers treated me
      quite right that time, but maybe they didn&#8217;t know the Ottawa dog was
      dead. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned my fighting from my mother when I was very young. We slept in a
      lumber-yard on the river-front, and by day hunted for food along the
      wharves. When we got it, the other tramp-dogs would try to take it off us,
      and then it was wonderful to see mother fly at them and drive them away.
      All I know of fighting I learned from mother, watching her picking the
      ash-heaps for me when I was too little to fight for myself. No one ever
      was so good to me as mother. When it snowed and the ice was in the St.
      Lawrence, she used to hunt alone, and bring me back new bones, and she&#8217;d
      sit and laugh to see me trying to swallow &#8217;em whole. I was just a
      puppy then; my teeth was falling out. When I was able to fight we kept the
      whole river-range to ourselves. I had the genuine long &#8220;punishing&#8221;
      jaw, so mother said, and there wasn&#8217;t a man or a dog that dared
      worry us. Those were happy days, those were; and we lived well, share and
      share alike, and when we wanted a bit of fun, we chased the fat old
      wharf-rats! My, how they would squeal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the trouble came. It was no trouble to me. I was too young to care
      then. But mother took it so to heart that she grew ailing, and wouldn&#8217;t
      go abroad with me by day. It was the same old scandal that they&#8217;re
      always bringing up against me. I was so young then that I didn&#8217;t
      know. I couldn&#8217;t see any difference between mother&#8211;and other
      mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day a pack of curs we drove off snarled back some new names at
      her, and mother dropped her head and ran, just as though they had whipped
      us. After that she wouldn&#8217;t go out with me except in the dark, and
      one day she went away and never came back, and, though I hunted for her in
      every court and alley and back street of Montreal, I never found her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, a month after mother ran away, I asked Guardian, the old blind
      mastiff, whose Master is the night watchman on our slip, what it all
      meant. And he told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Every dog in Montreal knows,&#8221; he says, &#8220;except you; and
      every Master knows. So I think it&#8217;s time you knew.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tells me that my father, who had treated mother so bad, was a
      great and noble gentleman from London. &#8220;Your father had twenty-two
      registered ancestors, had your father,&#8221; old Guardian says, &#8220;and
      in him was the best bull-terrier blood of England, the most ancientest,
      the most royal; the winning &#8216;blue-ribbon&#8217; blood, that breeds
      champions. He had sleepy pink eyes and thin pink lips, and he was as white
      all over as his own white teeth, and under his white skin you could see
      his muscles, hard and smooth, like the links of a steel chain. When your
      father stood still, and tipped his nose in the air, it was just as though
      he was saying, &#8216;Oh, yes, you common dogs and men, you may well
      stare. It must be a rare treat for you colonials to see real English
      royalty.&#8217; He certainly was pleased with hisself, was your father. He
      looked just as proud and haughty as one of them stone dogs in Victoria
      Park&#8211;them as is cut out of white marble. And you&#8217;re like him,&#8221;
      says the old mastiff&#8211;&#8220;by that, of course, meaning you&#8217;re
      white, same as him. That&#8217;s the only likeness. But, you see, the
      trouble is, Kid&#8211;well, you see, Kid, the trouble is&#8211;your mother&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That will do,&#8221; I said, for then I understood without his
      telling me, and I got up and walked away, holding my head and tail high in
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was, oh, so miserable, and I wanted to see mother that very minute,
      and tell her that I didn&#8217;t care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother is what I am, a street-dog; there&#8217;s no royal blood in mother&#8217;s
      veins, nor is she like that father of mine, nor&#8211;and that&#8217;s the
      worst&#8211;she&#8217;s not even like me. For while I, when I&#8217;m
      washed for a fight, am as white as clean snow, she&#8211;and this is our
      trouble&#8211;she, my mother, is a black-and-tan.

    <p>
      When mother hid herself from me, I was twelve months old and able to take
      care of myself, and as, after mother left me, the wharves were never the
      same, I moved uptown and met the Master. Before he came, lots of other
      men-folks had tried to make up to me, and to whistle me home. But they
      either tried patting me or coaxing me with a piece of meat; so I didn&#8217;t
      take to &#8217;em. But one day the Master pulled me out of a street-fight
      by the hind legs, and kicked me good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You want to fight, do you?&#8221; says he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
      you all the <i>fighting</i> you want!&#8221; he says, and he kicks me
      again. So I knew he was my Master, and I followed him home. Since that day
      I&#8217;ve pulled off many fights for him, and they&#8217;ve brought dogs
      from all over the province to have a go at me; but up to that night none,
      under thirty pounds, had ever downed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night, so soon as they carried me into the ring, I saw the dog
      was overweight, and that I was no match for him. It was asking too much of
      a puppy. The Master should have known I couldn&#8217;t do it. Not that I
      mean to blame the Master, for when sober, which he sometimes was&#8211;though
      not, as you might say, his habit&#8211;he was most kind to me, and let me
      out to find food, if I could get it, and only kicked me when I didn&#8217;t
      pick him up at night and lead him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But kicks will stiffen the muscles, and starving a dog so as to get him
      ugly-tempered for a fight may make him nasty, but it&#8217;s weakening to
      his insides, and it causes the legs to wobble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring was in a hall back of a public house. There was a red-hot
      whitewashed stove in one corner, and the ring in the other. I lay in the
      Master&#8217;s lap, wrapped in my blanket, and, spite of the stove,
      shivering awful; but I always shiver before a fight: I can&#8217;t help
      gettin&#8217; excited. While the men-folks were a-flashing their money and
      taking their last drink at the bar, a little Irish groom in gaiters came
      up to me and give me the back of his hand to smell, and scratched me
      behind the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You poor little pup,&#8221; says he; &#8220;you haven&#8217;t no
      show,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That brute in the tap-room he&#8217;ll eat
      your heart out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what <i>you</i> think,&#8221; says the Master,
      snarling. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you a quid the Kid chews him up.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom he shook his head, but kept looking at me so sorry-like that I
      begun to get a bit sad myself. He seemed like he couldn&#8217;t bear to
      leave off a-patting of me, and he says, speaking low just like he would to
      a man-folk, &#8220;Well, good luck to you, little pup,&#8221; which I
      thought so civil of him that I reached up and licked his hand. I don&#8217;t
      do that to many men. And the Master he knew I didn&#8217;t, and took on
      dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What &#8217;ave you got on the back of your hand?&#8221; says he,
      jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Soap!&#8221; says the groom, quick as a rat. &#8220;That&#8217;s
      more than you&#8217;ve got on yours. Do you want to smell of it?&#8221;
      and he sticks his fist under the Master&#8217;s nose. But the pals pushed
      in between &#8217;em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He tried to poison the Kid!&#8221; shouts the Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, one fight at a time,&#8221; says the referee. &#8220;Get into
      the ring, Jerry. We&#8217;re waiting.&#8221; So we went into the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never could just remember what did happen in that ring. He give me no
      time to spring. He fell on me like a horse. I couldn&#8217;t keep my feet
      against him, and though, as I saw, he could get his hold when he liked, he
      wanted to chew me over a bit first. I was wondering if they&#8217;d be
      able to pry him off me, when, in the third round, he took his hold; and I
      begun to drown, just as I did when I fell into the river off the Red C
      slip. He closed deeper and deeper on my throat, and everything went black
      and red and bursting; and then, when I were sure I were dead, the handlers
      pulled him off, and the Master give me a kick that brought me to. But I
      couldn&#8217;t move none, or even wink, both eyes being shut with lumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s a cur!&#8221; yells the Master, &#8220;a sneaking,
      cowardly cur! He lost the fight for me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;because he&#8217;s
      a &#8213; &#8213; &#8213; cowardly cur.&#8221; And he kicks me again in
      the lower ribs, so that I go sliding across the sawdust. &#8220;There&#8217;s
      gratitude fer yer,&#8221; yells the Master. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fed that
      dog, and nussed that dog and housed him like a prince; and now he puts his
      tail between his legs and sells me out, he does. He&#8217;s a coward! I&#8217;ve
      done with him, I am. I&#8217;d sell him for a pipeful of tobacco.&#8221;
      He picked me up by the tail, and swung me for the men-folks to see.
      &#8220;Does any gentleman here want to buy a dog,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to
      make into sausage-meat?&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s all he&#8217;s
      good for.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard the little Irish groom say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you ten
      bob for the dog.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And another voice says, &#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t you do it; the dog&#8217;s
      same as dead&#8211;mebbe he is dead.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ten shillings!&#8221; says the Master, and his voice sobers a bit;
      &#8220;make it two pounds and he&#8217;s yours.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the pals rushed in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you be a fool, Jerry,&#8221; they say. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
      be sorry for this when you&#8217;re sober. The Kid&#8217;s worth a fiver.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my eyes was not so swelled up as the other, and as I hung by my
      tail, I opened it, and saw one of the pals take the groom by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You ought to give &#8217;im five pounds for that dog, mate,&#8221;
      he says; &#8220;that&#8217;s no ordinary dog. That dog&#8217;s got good
      blood in him, that dog has. Why, his father&#8211;that very dog&#8217;s
      father&#8213;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought he never would go on. He waited like he wanted to be sure the
      groom was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That very dog&#8217;s father,&#8221; says the pal, &#8220;is Regent
      Royal, son of Champion Regent Monarch, champion bull-terrier of England
      for four years.&#8221;
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter">
      <img src="images/i-230.jpg" id="img007" alt="" />
      <p class="center caption">
        &#8220;He&#8217;s a coward, I&#8217;ve done with him.&#8221;
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--  figure -->
    <p>
      I was sore, and torn, and chewed most awful, but what the pal said sounded
      so fine that I wanted to wag my tail, only couldn&#8217;t, owing to my
      hanging from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Master calls out: &#8220;Yes, his father was Regent Royal; who&#8217;s
      saying he wasn&#8217;t? but the pup&#8217;s a cowardly cur, that&#8217;s
      what his pup is. And why? I&#8217;ll tell you why: because his mother was
      a black-and-tan street-dog, that&#8217;s why!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&#8217;t see how I got the strength, but, someway, I threw myself out
      of the Master&#8217;s grip and fell at his feet, and turned over and
      fastened all my teeth in his ankle, just across the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I woke, after the pals had kicked me off him, I was in the
      smoking-car of a railroad-train, lying in the lap of the little groom, and
      he was rubbing my open wounds with a greasy yellow stuff, exquisite to the
      smell and most agreeable to lick off.

      PART II
    </p>
    <p class="tiz">
      &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s your name&#8211;Nolan? Well, Nolan, these
      references are satisfactory,&#8221; said the young gentleman my new Master
      called &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you on as
      second man. You can begin to-day.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      My new Master shuffled his feet and put his finger to his forehead.
      &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; says he. Then he choked like he had
      swallowed a fish-bone. &#8220;I have a little dawg, sir,&#8221; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep him,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221;
      very short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s only a puppy, sir,&#8221; says my new Master;
      &#8220;&#8217;e wouldn&#8217;t go outside the stables, sir.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not that,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir.&#8221;
      &#8220;I have a large kennel of very fine dogs; they&#8217;re the best of
      their breed in America. I don&#8217;t allow strange dogs on the premises.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Master shakes his head, and motions me with his cap, and I crept out
      from behind the door. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir,&#8221; says the Master.
      &#8220;Then I can&#8217;t take the place. I can&#8217;t get along without
      the dawg, sir.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; looked at me that fierce that I guessed he
      was going to whip me, so I turned over on my back and begged with my legs
      and tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, you beat him!&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; very
      stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No fear!&#8221; the Master says, getting very red. &#8220;The party
      I bought him off taught him that. He never learnt that from me!&#8221; He
      picked me up in his arms, and to show &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; how
      well I loved the Master, I bit his chin and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; turned over the letters the Master had
      given him. &#8220;Well, these references certainly are very strong,&#8221;
      he says. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll let the dog stay. Only see you keep him
      away from the kennels&#8211;or you&#8217;ll both go.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; says the Master, grinning like a cat when
      she&#8217;s safe behind the area railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not a bad bull-terrier,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham,
      sir,&#8221; feeling my head. &#8220;Not that I know much about the
      smooth-coated breeds. My dogs are St. Bernards.&#8221; He stopped patting
      me and held up my nose. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with his ears?&#8221;
      he says. &#8220;They&#8217;re chewed to pieces. Is this a fighting dog?&#8221;
      he asks, quick and rough-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have laughed. If he hadn&#8217;t been holding my nose, I certainly
      would have had a good grin at him. Me the best under thirty pounds in the
      Province of Quebec, and him asking if I was a fighting dog! I ran to the
      Master and hung down my head modest-like, waiting for him to tell my list
      of battles; but the Master he coughs in his cap most painful. &#8220;Fightin&#8217;
      dawg, sir!&#8221; he cries. &#8220;Lor&#8217; bless you, sir, the Kid don&#8217;t
      know the word. &#8217;E&#8217;s just a puppy, sir, same as you see; a pet
      dog, so to speak. &#8217;E&#8217;s a regular old lady&#8217;s lap-dog, the
      Kid is.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you keep him away from my St. Bernards,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr.
      Wyndham, sir,&#8221; &#8220;or they might make a mouthful of him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, sir; that they might,&#8221; says the Master. But when we gets
      outside he slaps his knee and laughs inside hisself, and winks at me most
      sociable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Master&#8217;s new home was in the country, in a province they called
      Long Island. There was a high stone wall about his home with big iron
      gates to it, same as Godfrey&#8217;s brewery; and there was a house with
      five red roofs; and the stables, where I lived, was cleaner than the
      aërated bakery-shop. And then there was the kennels; but they was like
      nothing else in this world that ever I see. For the first days I couldn&#8217;t
      sleep of nights for fear some one would catch me lying in such a
      cleaned-up place, and would chase me out of it; and when I did fall to
      sleep I&#8217;d dream I was back in the old Master&#8217;s attic,
      shivering under the rusty stove, which never had no coals in it, with the
      Master flat on his back on the cold floor, with his clothes on. And I&#8217;d
      wake up scared and whimpering, and find myself on the new Master&#8217;s
      cot with his hand on the quilt beside me; and I&#8217;d see the glow of
      the big stove, and hear the high-quality horses below-stairs stamping in
      their straw-lined boxes, and I&#8217;d snoop the sweet smell of hay and
      harness-soap and go to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stables was my jail, so the Master said, but I don&#8217;t ask no
      better home than that jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, Kid,&#8221; says he, sitting on the top of a bucket upside
      down, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to understand this. When I whistle it means
      you&#8217;re not to go out of this &#8217;ere yard. These stables is your
      jail. If you leave &#8217;em I&#8217;ll have to leave &#8217;em too, and
      over the seas, in the County Mayo, an old mother will &#8217;ave to leave
      her bit of a cottage. For two pounds I must be sending her every month, or
      she&#8217;ll have naught to eat, nor no thatch over &#8217;er head. I can&#8217;t
      lose my place, Kid, so see you don&#8217;t lose it for me. You must keep
      away from the kennels,&#8221; says he; &#8220;they&#8217;re not for the
      likes of you. The kennels are for the quality. I wouldn&#8217;t take a
      litter of them woolly dogs for one wag of your tail, Kid, but for all that
      they are your betters, same as the gentry up in the big house are my
      betters. I know my place and keep away from the gentry, and you keep away
      from the champions.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I never goes out of the stables. All day I just lay in the sun on the
      stone flags, licking my jaws, and watching the grooms wash down the
      carriages, and the only care I had was to see they didn&#8217;t get gay
      and turn the hose on me. There wasn&#8217;t even a single rat to plague
      me. Such stables I never did see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nolan,&#8221; says the head groom, &#8220;some day that dog of
      yours will give you the slip. You can&#8217;t keep a street-dog tied up
      all his life. It&#8217;s against his natur&#8217;.&#8221; The head groom
      is a nice old gentleman, but he doesn&#8217;t know everything. Just as
      though I&#8217;d been a street-dog because I liked it! As if I&#8217;d
      rather poke for my vittles in ash-heaps than have &#8217;em handed me in a
      wash-basin, and would sooner bite and fight than be polite and sociable.
      If I&#8217;d had mother there I couldn&#8217;t have asked for nothing
      more. But I&#8217;d think of her snooping in the gutters, or freezing of
      nights under the bridges, or, what&#8217;s worst of all, running through
      the hot streets with her tongue down, so wild and crazy for a drink that
      the people would shout &#8220;mad dog&#8221; at her and stone her. Water&#8217;s
      so good that I don&#8217;t blame the men-folks for locking it up inside
      their houses; but when the hot days come, I think they might remember that
      those are the dog-days, and leave a little water outside in a trough, like
      they do for the horses. Then we wouldn&#8217;t go mad, and the policemen
      wouldn&#8217;t shoot us. I had so much of everything I wanted that it made
      me think a lot of the days when I hadn&#8217;t nothing, and if I could
      have given what I had to mother, as she used to share with me, I&#8217;d
      have been the happiest dog in the land. Not that I wasn&#8217;t happy
      then, and most grateful to the Master, too, and if I&#8217;d only minded
      him, the trouble wouldn&#8217;t have come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day the coachman says that the little lady they called Miss
      Dorothy had come back from school, and that same morning she runs over to
      the stables to pat her ponies, and she sees me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, what a nice little, white little dog!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Whose
      little dog are you?&#8221; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s my dog, miss,&#8221; says the Master. &#8220;&#8217;Is
      name is Kid.&#8221; And I ran up to her most polite, and licks her
      fingers, for I never see so pretty and kind a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You must come with me and call on my new puppies,&#8221; says she,
      picking me up in her arms and starting off with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, but please, miss,&#8221; cries Nolan, &#8220;Mr. Wyndham give
      orders that the Kid&#8217;s not to go to the kennels.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; says the little lady; &#8220;they&#8217;re
      my kennels too. And the puppies will like to play with him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      You wouldn&#8217;t believe me if I was to tell you of the style of them
      quality-dogs. If I hadn&#8217;t seen it myself I wouldn&#8217;t have
      believed it neither. The Viceroy of Canada don&#8217;t live no better.
      There was forty of them, but each one had his own house and a yard&#8211;most
      exclusive&#8211;and a cot and a drinking-basin all to hisself. They had
      servants standing round waiting to feed &#8217;em when they was hungry,
      and valets to wash &#8217;em; and they had their hair combed and brushed
      like the grooms must when they go out on the box. Even the puppies had
      overcoats with their names on &#8217;em in blue letters, and the name of
      each of those they called champions was painted up fine over his front
      door just like it was a public house or a veterinary&#8217;s. They were
      the biggest St. Bernards I ever did see. I could have walked under them if
      they&#8217;d have let me. But they were very proud and haughty dogs, and
      looked only once at me, and then sniffed in the air. The little lady&#8217;s
      own dog was an old gentleman bull-dog. He&#8217;d come along with us, and
      when he notices how taken aback I was with all I see, &#8217;e turned
      quite kind and affable and showed me about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jimmy Jocks,&#8221; Miss Dorothy called him, but, owing to his
      weight, he walked most dignified and slow, waddling like a duck, as you
      might say, and looked much too proud and handsome for such a silly name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s the runway, and that&#8217;s the trophy-house,&#8221;
      says he to me, &#8220;and that over there is the hospital, where you have
      to go if you get distemper, and the vet gives you beastly medicine.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And which of these is your &#8217;ouse, sir?&#8221; asks I, wishing
      to be respectful. But he looked that hurt and haughty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
      live in the kennels,&#8221; says he, most contemptuous. &#8220;I am a
      house-dog. I sleep in Miss Dorothy&#8217;s room. And at lunch I&#8217;m
      let in with the family, if the visitors don&#8217;t mind. They &#8217;most
      always do, but they&#8217;re too polite to say so. Besides,&#8221; says
      he, smiling most condescending, &#8220;visitors are always afraid of me.
      It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m so ugly,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221;
      says he, screwing up his wrinkles and speaking very slow and impressive,
      &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m the ugliest bull-dog in America&#8221;; and as
      he seemed to be so pleased to think hisself so, I said, &#8220;Yes, sir;
      you certainly are the ugliest ever I see,&#8221; at which he nodded his
      head most approving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t hurt &#8217;em, as you say,&#8221; he goes on,
      though I hadn&#8217;t said nothing like that, being too polite. &#8220;I&#8217;m
      too old,&#8221; he says; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any teeth. The last time
      one of those grizzly bears,&#8221; said he, glaring at the big St.
      Bernards, &#8220;took a hold of me, he nearly was my death,&#8221; says
      he. I thought his eyes would pop out of his head, he seemed so wrought up
      about it. &#8220;He rolled me around in the dirt, he did,&#8221; says
      Jimmy Jocks, &#8220;an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t get up. It was low,&#8221;
      says Jimmy Jocks, making a face like he had a bad taste in his mouth.
      &#8220;Low, that&#8217;s what I call it&#8211;bad form, you understand,
      young man, not done in my set&#8211;and&#8211;and low.&#8221; He growled
      &#8217;way down in his stomach, and puffed hisself out, panting and
      blowing like he had been on a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not a street fighter,&#8221; he says, scowling at a St.
      Bernard marked &#8220;Champion.&#8221; &#8220;And when my rheumatism is
      not troubling me,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I endeavor to be civil to all
      dogs, so long as they are gentlemen.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said I, for even to me he had been most affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this we had come to a little house off by itself, and Jimmy Jocks
      invites me in. &#8220;This is their trophy-room,&#8221; he says, &#8220;where
      they keep their prizes. Mine,&#8221; he says, rather grand-like, &#8220;are
      on the sideboard.&#8221; Not knowing what a sideboard might be, I said,
      &#8220;Indeed, sir, that must be very gratifying.&#8221; But he only
      wrinkled up his chops as much as to say, &#8220;It is my right.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The trophy-room was as wonderful as any public house I ever see. On the
      walls was pictures of nothing but beautiful St. Bernard dogs, and rows and
      rows of blue and red and yellow ribbons; and when I asked Jimmy Jocks why
      they was so many more of blue than of the others, he laughs and says,
      &#8220;Because these kennels always win.&#8221; And there was many shining
      cups on the shelves, which Jimmy Jocks told me were prizes won by the
      champions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, sir, might I ask you, sir,&#8221; says I, &#8220;wot is a
      champion?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he panted and breathed so hard I thought he would bust hisself.
      &#8220;My dear young friend!&#8221; says he, &#8220;wherever have you been
      educated? A champion is a&#8211;a champion,&#8221; he says. &#8220;He must
      win nine blue ribbons in the &#8216;open&#8217; class. You follow me&#8211;that
      is&#8211;against all comers. Then he has the title before his name, and
      they put his photograph in the sporting papers. You know, of course, that
      I am a champion,&#8221; says he. &#8220;I am Champion Woodstock Wizard
      III, and the two other Woodstock Wizards, my father and uncle, were both
      champions.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I thought your name was Jimmy Jocks,&#8221; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughs right out at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s my kennel name, not my registered name,&#8221; he
      says. &#8220;Why, certainly you know that every dog has two names. Now,
      for instance, what&#8217;s your registered name and number?&#8221; says
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve got only one name,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Just Kid.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Woodstock Wizard puffs at that and wrinkles up his forehead and pops out
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who are your people?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Where is your home?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;At the stable, sir,&#8221; I said. &#8220;My Master is the second
      groom.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Woodstock Wizard III looks at me for quite a bit without winking,
      and stares all around the room over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; says he at last, &#8220;you&#8217;re a very civil
      young dog,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and I blame no one for what he can&#8217;t
      help,&#8221; which I thought most fair and liberal. &#8220;And I have
      known many bull-terriers that were champions,&#8221; says he, &#8220;though
      as a rule they mostly run with fire-engines and to fighting. For me, I
      wouldn&#8217;t care to run through the streets after a hose-cart, nor to
      fight,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but each to his taste.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help thinking that if Woodstock Wizard III tried to follow a
      fire-engine he would die of apoplexy, and seeing he&#8217;d lost his
      teeth, it was lucky he had no taste for fighting; but, after his being so
      condescending, I didn&#8217;t say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Anyway,&#8221; says he, &#8220;every smooth-coated dog is better
      than any hairy old camel like those St. Bernards, and if ever you&#8217;re
      hungry down at the stables, young man, come up to the house and I&#8217;ll
      give you a bone. I can&#8217;t eat them myself, but I bury them around the
      garden from force of habit and in case a friend should drop in. Ah, I see
      my mistress coming,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and I bid you good day. I
      regret,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that our different social position prevents
      our meeting frequent, for you&#8217;re a worthy young dog with a proper
      respect for your betters, and in this country there&#8217;s precious few
      of them have that.&#8221; Then he waddles off, leaving me alone and very
      sad, for he was the first dog in many days that had spoke to me. But since
      he showed, seeing that I was a stable-dog, he didn&#8217;t want my
      company, I waited for him to get well away. It was not a cheerful place to
      wait, the trophy-house. The pictures of the champions seemed to scowl at
      me, and ask what right such as I had even to admire them, and the blue and
      gold ribbons and the silver cups made me very miserable. I had never won
      no blue ribbons or silver cups, only stakes for the old Master to spend in
      the publics; and I hadn&#8217;t won them for being a beautiful
      high-quality dog, but just for fighting&#8211;which, of course, as
      Woodstock Wizard III says, is low. So I started for the stables, with my
      head down and my tail between my legs, feeling sorry I had ever left the
      Master. But I had more reason to be sorry before I got back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trophy-house was quite a bit from the kennels, and as I left it I see
      Miss Dorothy and Woodstock Wizard III walking back toward them, and, also,
      that a big St. Bernard, his name was Champion Red Elfberg, had broke his
      chain and was running their way. When he reaches old Jimmy Jocks he lets
      out a roar like a grain-steamer in a fog, and he makes three leaps for
      him. Old Jimmy Jocks was about a fourth his size; but he plants his feet
      and curves his back, and his hair goes up around his neck like a collar.
      But he never had no show at no time, for the grizzly bear, as Jimmy Jocks
      had called him, lights on old Jimmy&#8217;s back and tries to break it,
      and old Jimmy Jocks snaps his gums and claws the grass, panting and
      groaning awful. But he can&#8217;t do nothing, and the grizzly bear just
      rolls him under him, biting and tearing cruel. The odds was all that
      Woodstock Wizard III was going to be killed; I had fought enough to see
      that: but not knowing the rules of the game among champions, I didn&#8217;t
      like to interfere between two gentlemen who might be settling a private
      affair, and, as it were, take it as presuming of me. So I stood by, though
      I was shaking terrible, and holding myself in like I was on a leash. But
      at that Woodstock Wizard III, who was underneath, sees me through the
      dust, and calls very faint, &#8220;Help, you!&#8221; he says. &#8220;Take
      him in the hind leg,&#8221; he says. &#8220;He&#8217;s murdering me,&#8221;
      he says. And then the little Miss Dorothy, who was crying, and calling to
      the kennel-men, catches at the Red Elfberg&#8217;s hind legs to pull him
      off, and the brute, keeping his front pats well in Jimmy&#8217;s stomach,
      turns his big head and snaps at her. So that was all I asked for, thank
      you. I went up under him. It was really nothing. He stood so high that I
      had only to take off about three feet from him and come in from the side,
      and my long &#8220;punishing jaw,&#8221; as mother was always talking
      about, locked on his woolly throat, and my back teeth met. I couldn&#8217;t
      shake him, but I shook myself, and every time I shook myself there was
      thirty pounds of weight tore at his wind-pipes. I couldn&#8217;t see
      nothing for his long hair, but I heard Jimmy Jocks puffing and blowing on
      one side, and munching the brute&#8217;s leg with his old gums. Jimmy was
      an old sport that day, was Jimmy, or Woodstock Wizard III, as I should
      say. When the Red Elfberg was out and down I had to run, or those
      kennel-men would have had my life. They chased me right into the stables;
      and from under the hay I watched the head groom take down a carriage-whip
      and order them to the right about. Luckily Master and the young grooms
      were out, or that day there&#8217;d have been fighting for everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it nearly did for me and the Master. &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221;
      comes raging to the stables. I&#8217;d half killed his best prize-winner,
      he says, and had oughter be shot, and he gives the Master his notice. But
      Miss Dorothy she follows him, and says it was his Red Elfberg what began
      the fight, and that I&#8217;d saved Jimmy&#8217;s life, and that old Jimmy
      Jocks was worth more to her than all the St. Bernards in the Swiss
      mountains&#8211;wherever they may be. And that I was her champion, anyway.
      Then, she cried over me most beautiful, and over Jimmy Jocks, too, who was
      that tied up in bandages he couldn&#8217;t even waddle. So when he heard
      that side of it, &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; told us that if Nolan put
      me on a chain we could stay. So it came out all right for everybody but
      me. I was glad the Master kept his place, but I&#8217;d never worn a chain
      before, and it disheartened me. But that was the least of it. For the
      quality-dogs couldn&#8217;t forgive my whipping their champion, and they
      came to the fence between the kennels and the stables, and laughed through
      the bars, barking most cruel words at me. I couldn&#8217;t understand how
      they found it out, but they knew. After the fight Jimmy Jocks was most
      condescending to me, and he said the grooms had boasted to the kennel-men
      that I was a son of Regent Royal, and that when the kennel-men asked who
      was my mother they had had to tell them that too. Perhaps that was the way
      of it, but, however, the scandal got out, and every one of the
      quality-dogs knew that I was a street-dog and the son of a black-and-tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;These misalliances will occur,&#8221; said Jimmy Jocks, in his
      old-fashioned way; &#8220;but no well-bred dog,&#8221; says he, looking
      most scornful at the St. Bernards, who were howling behind the palings,
      &#8220;would refer to your misfortune before you, certainly not cast it in
      your face. I myself remember your father&#8217;s father, when he made his
      début at the Crystal Palace. He took four blue ribbons and three specials.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner than Jimmy would leave me the St. Bernards would take to
      howling again, insulting mother and insulting me. And when I tore at my
      chain, they, seeing they were safe, would howl the more. It was never the
      same after that; the laughs and the jeers cut into my heart, and the chain
      bore heavy on my spirit. I was so sad that sometimes I wished I was back
      in the gutter again, where no one was better than me, and some nights I
      wished I was dead. If it hadn&#8217;t been for the Master being so kind,
      and that it would have looked like I was blaming mother, I would have
      twisted my leash and hanged myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a month after my fight, the word was passed through the kennels that
      the New York Show was coming, and such goings on as followed I never did
      see. If each of them had been matched to fight for a thousand pounds and
      the gate, they couldn&#8217;t have trained more conscientious. But perhaps
      that&#8217;s just my envy. The kennel-men rubbed &#8217;em and scrubbed
      &#8217;em, and trims their hair and curls and combs it, and some dogs they
      fatted and some they starved. No one talked of nothing but the Show, and
      the chances &#8220;our kennels&#8221; had against the other kennels, and
      if this one of our champions would win over that one, and whether them as
      hoped to be champions had better show in the &#8220;open&#8221; or the
      &#8220;limit&#8221; class, and whether this dog would beat his own dad, or
      whether his little puppy sister couldn&#8217;t beat the two of &#8217;em.
      Even the grooms had their money up, and day or night you heard nothing but
      praises of &#8220;our&#8221; dogs, until I, being so far out of it, couldn&#8217;t
      have felt meaner if I had been running the streets with a can to my tail.
      I knew shows were not for such as me, and so all day I lay stretched at
      the end of my chain, pretending I was asleep, and only too glad that they
      had something so important to think of that they could leave me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day, before the Show opened, Miss Dorothy came to the stables with
      &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; and seeing me chained up and so miserable,
      she takes me in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You poor little tyke!&#8221; says she. &#8220;It&#8217;s cruel to
      tie him up so; he&#8217;s eating his heart out, Nolan,&#8221; she says.
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know nothing about bull-terriers,&#8221; says she,
      &#8220;but I think Kid&#8217;s got good points,&#8221; says she, &#8220;and
      you ought to show him. Jimmy Jocks has three legs on the Rensselaer Cup
      now, and I&#8217;m going to show him this time, so that he can get the
      fourth; and, if you wish, I&#8217;ll enter your dog too. How would you
      like that, Kid?&#8221; says she. &#8220;How would you like to see the most
      beautiful dogs in the world? Maybe you&#8217;d meet a pal or two,&#8221;
      says she. &#8220;It would cheer you up, wouldn&#8217;t it, Kid?&#8221;
      says she. But I was so upset I could only wag my tail most violent.
      &#8220;He says it would!&#8221; says she, though, being that excited, I
      hadn&#8217;t said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; laughs, and takes out a piece of blue
      paper and sits down at the head groom&#8217;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s the name of the father of your dog, Nolan?&#8221; says
      he. And Nolan says: &#8220;The man I got him off told me he was a son of
      Champion Regent Royal, sir. But it don&#8217;t seem likely, does it?&#8221;
      says Nolan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It does not!&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221;
      short-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you sure, Nolan?&#8221; says Miss Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, miss,&#8221; says the Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sire unknown,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; and
      writes it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Date of birth?&#8221; asks &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;unknown, sir,&#8221; says Nolan. And &#8220;Mr.
      Wyndham, sir,&#8221; writes it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Breeder?&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Unknown,&#8221; says Nolan, getting very red around the jaws, and I
      drops my head and tail. And &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; writes that
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother&#8217;s name?&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She was a&#8211;unknown,&#8221; says the Master. And I licks his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dam unknown,&#8221; says &#8220;Mr. Wyndham, sir,&#8221; and writes
      it down. Then he takes the paper and reads out loud: &#8220;&#8217;Sire
      unknown, dam unknown, breeder unknown, date of birth unknown.&#8217; You&#8217;d
      better call him the &#8216;Great Unknown,&#8217;&#8221; says he. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
      paying his entrance fee?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am,&#8221; says Miss Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks after we all got on a train for New York, Jimmy Jocks and me
      following Nolan in the smoking-car, and twenty-two of the St. Bernards in
      boxes and crates and on chains and leashes. Such a barking and howling I
      never did hear; and when they sees me going, too, they laughs fit to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wot is this&#8211;a circus?&#8221; says the railroad man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had no heart in it. I hated to go. I knew I was no &#8220;show&#8221;
      dog, even though Miss Dorothy and the Master did their best to keep me
      from shaming them. For before we set out Miss Dorothy brings a man from
      town who scrubbed and rubbed me, and sandpapered my tail, which hurt most
      awful, and shaved my ears with the Master&#8217;s razor, so you could
      &#8217;most see clear through &#8217;em, and sprinkles me over with
      pipe-clay, till I shines like a Tommy&#8217;s cross-belts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Upon my word!&#8221; says Jimmy Jocks when he first sees me.
      &#8220;Wot a swell you are! You&#8217;re the image of your grand-dad when
      he made his début at the Crystal Palace. He took four firsts and three
      specials.&#8221; But I knew he was only trying to throw heart into me.
      They might scrub, and they might rub, and they might pipe-clay, but they
      couldn&#8217;t pipe-clay the insides of me, and they was black-and-tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we came to a garden, which it was not, but the biggest hall in the
      world. Inside there was lines of benches a few miles long, and on them sat
      every dog in America. If all the dog snatchers in Montreal had worked
      night and day for a year, they couldn&#8217;t have caught so many dogs.
      And they was all shouting and barking and howling so vicious that my heart
      stopped beating. For at first I thought they was all enraged at my
      presuming to intrude. But after I got in my place they kept at it just the
      same, barking at every dog as he come in: daring him to fight, and
      ordering him out, and asking him what breed of dog he thought he was,
      anyway. Jimmy Jocks was chained just behind me, and he said he never see
      so fine a show. &#8220;That&#8217;s a hot class you&#8217;re in, my lad,&#8221;
      he says, looking over into my street, where there were thirty bull
      terriers. They was all as white as cream, and each so beautiful that if I
      could have broke my chain I would have run all the way home and hid myself
      under the horse trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long they talked and sang, and passed greetings with old pals,
      and the homesick puppies howled dismal. Them that couldn&#8217;t sleep
      wouldn&#8217;t let no others sleep, and all the electric lights burned in
      the roof, and in my eyes. I could hear Jimmy Jocks snoring peaceful, but I
      could only doze by jerks, and when I dozed I dreamed horrible. All the
      dogs in the hall seemed coming at me for daring to intrude, with their
      jaws red and open, and their eyes blazing like the lights in the roof.
      &#8220;You&#8217;re a street dog! Get out, you street dog!&#8221; they
      yells. And as they drives me out, the pipe clay drops off me, and they
      laugh and shriek; and when I looks down I see that I have turned into a
      black-and-tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      They was most awful dreams, and next morning, when Miss Dorothy comes and
      gives me water in a pan, I begs and begs her to take me home; but she can&#8217;t
      understand. &#8220;How well Kid is!&#8221; she says. And when I jumps into
      the Master&#8217;s arms and pulls to break my chain, he says, &#8220;If he
      knew all as he had against him, miss, he wouldn&#8217;t be so gay.&#8221;
      And from a book they reads out the names of the beautiful high-bred
      terriers which I have got to meet. And I can&#8217;t make &#8217;em
      understand that I only want to run away and hide myself where no one will
      see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly men comes hurrying down our street and begins to brush the
      beautiful bull-terriers; and the Master rubs me with a towel so excited
      that his hands trembles awful, and Miss Dorothy tweaks my ears between her
      gloves, so that the blood runs to &#8217;em, and they turn pink and stand
      up straight and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, then, Nolan,&#8221; says she, her voice shaking just like his
      fingers, &#8220;keep his head up&#8211;and never let the judge lose sight
      of him.&#8221; When I hears that my legs breaks under me, for I knows all
      about judges. Twice the old Master goes up before the judge for fighting
      me with other dogs, and the judge promises him if he ever does it again he&#8217;ll
      chain him up in jail. I knew he&#8217;d find me out. A judge can&#8217;t
      be fooled by no pipe-clay. He can see right through you, and he reads your
      insides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judging-ring, which is where the judge holds out, was so like a
      fighting-pit that when I come in it, and find six other dogs there, I
      springs into position, so that when they lets us go I can defend myself.
      But the Master smooths down my hair and whispers, &#8220;Hold &#8217;ard,
      Kid, hold &#8217;ard. This ain&#8217;t a fight,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Look
      your prettiest,&#8221; he whispers. &#8220;Please, Kid, look your
      prettiest&#8221;; and he pulls my leash so tight that I can&#8217;t touch
      my pats to the sawdust, and my nose goes up in the air. There was millions
      of people a-watching us from the railings, and three of our kennel-men,
      too, making fun of the Master and me, and Miss Dorothy with her chin just
      reaching to the rail, and her eyes so big that I thought she was a-going
      to cry. It was awful to think that when the judge stood up and exposed me,
      all those people, and Miss Dorothy, would be there to see me driven from
      the Show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge he was a fierce-looking man with specs on his nose, and a red
      beard. When I first come in he didn&#8217;t see me, owing to my being too
      quick for him and dodging behind the Master. But when the Master drags me
      round and I pulls at the sawdust to keep back, the judge looks at us
      careless-like, and then stops and glares through his specs, and I knew it
      was all up with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are there any more?&#8221; asks the judge to the gentleman at the
      gate, but never taking his specs from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the gate looks in his book. &#8220;Seven in the novice class,&#8221;
      says he. &#8220;They&#8217;re all here. You can go ahead,&#8221; and he
      shuts the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge he doesn&#8217;t hesitate a moment. He just waves his hand
      toward the corner of the ring. &#8220;Take him away,&#8221; he says to the
      Master, &#8220;over there, and keep him away&#8221;; and he turns and
      looks most solemn at the six beautiful bull-terriers. I don&#8217;t know
      how I crawled to that corner. I wanted to scratch under the sawdust and
      dig myself a grave. The kennel-men they slapped the rail with their hands
      and laughed at the Master like they would fall over. They pointed at me in
      the corner, and their sides just shaked. But little Miss Dorothy she
      presses her lips tight against the rail, and I see tears rolling from her
      eyes. The Master he hangs his head like he had been whipped. I felt most
      sorry for him than all. He was so red, and he was letting on not to see
      the kennel-men, and blinking his eyes. If the judge had ordered me right
      out it wouldn&#8217;t have disgraced us so, but it was keeping me there
      while he was judging the high-bred dogs that hurt so hard. With all those
      people staring, too. And his doing it so quick, without no doubt nor
      questions. You can&#8217;t fool the judges. They see inside you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he couldn&#8217;t make up his mind about them high-bred dogs. He
      scowls at &#8217;em, and he glares at &#8217;em, first with his head on
      the one side and then on the other. And he feels of &#8217;em, and orders
      &#8217;em to run about. And Nolan leans against the rails, with his head
      hung down, and pats me. And Miss Dorothy comes over beside him, but don&#8217;t
      say nothing, only wipes her eye with her finger. A man on the other side
      of the rail he says to the Master, &#8220;The judge don&#8217;t like your
      dog?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No,&#8221; says the Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Have you ever shown him before?&#8221; says the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No,&#8221; says the Master, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll never show him
      again. He&#8217;s my dog,&#8221; says the Master, &#8220;and he suits me!
      And I don&#8217;t care what no judges think.&#8221; And when he says them
      kind words, I licks his hand most grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge had two of the six dogs on a little platform in the middle of
      the ring, and he had chased the four other dogs into the corners, where
      they was licking their chops, and letting on they didn&#8217;t care, same
      as Nolan was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two dogs on the platform was so beautiful that the judge hisself
      couldn&#8217;t tell which was the best of &#8217;em, even when he stoops
      down and holds their heads together. But at last he gives a sigh, and
      brushes the sawdust off his knees, and goes to the table in the ring,
      where there was a man keeping score, and heaps and heaps of blue and gold
      and red and yellow ribbons. And the judge picks up a bunch of &#8217;em
      and walks to the two gentlemen who was holding the beautiful dogs, and he
      says to each, &#8220;What&#8217;s his number?&#8221; and he hands each
      gentleman a ribbon. And then he turned sharp and comes straight at the
      Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s his number?&#8221; says the judge. And Master was so
      scared that he couldn&#8217;t make no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Dorothy claps her hands and cries out like she was laughing,
      &#8220;Three twenty-six,&#8221; and the judge writes it down and shoves
      Master the blue ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bit the Master, and I jumps and bit Miss Dorothy, and I waggled so hard
      that the Master couldn&#8217;t hold me. When I get to the gate Miss
      Dorothy snatches me up and kisses me between the ears, right before
      millions of people, and they both hold me so tight that I didn&#8217;t
      know which of them was carrying of me. But one thing I knew, for I
      listened hard, as it was the judge hisself as said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did you see that puppy I gave first to?&#8221; says the judge to
      the gentleman at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I did. He was a bit out of his class,&#8221; says the gate
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He certainly was!&#8221; says the judge, and they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I didn&#8217;t care. They couldn&#8217;t hurt me then, not with Nolan
      holding the blue ribbon and Miss Dorothy hugging my ears, and the
      kennel-men sneaking away, each looking like he&#8217;d been caught with
      his nose under the lid of the slop-can.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down together, and we all three just talked as fast as we could.
      They was so pleased that I couldn&#8217;t help feeling proud myself, and I
      barked and leaped about so gay that all the bull-terriers in our street
      stretched on their chains and howled at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just look at him!&#8221; says one of those I had beat. &#8220;What&#8217;s
      he giving hisself airs about?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Because he&#8217;s got one blue ribbon!&#8221; says another of
      &#8217;em. &#8220;Why, when I was a puppy I used to eat &#8217;em, and if
      that judge could ever learn to know a toy from a mastiff, I&#8217;d have
      had this one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jimmy Jocks he leaned over from his bench and says, &#8220;Well done,
      Kid. Didn&#8217;t I tell you so?&#8221; What he &#8217;ad told me was that
      I might get a &#8220;commended,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t remind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you,&#8221; says Jimmy Jocks, &#8220;that I saw
      your grandfather make his début at the Crystal&#8211;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, sir, you did, sir,&#8221; says I, for I have no love for the
      men of my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman with a showing-leash around his neck comes up just then and
      looks at me very critical. &#8220;Nice dog you&#8217;ve got, Miss Wyndham,&#8221;
      says he; &#8220;would you care to sell him?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not my dog,&#8221; says Miss Dorothy, holding me tight.
      &#8220;I wish he were.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not for sale, sir,&#8221; says the Master, and I was <i>that</i>
      glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s yours, is he?&#8221; says the gentleman, looking
      hard at Nolan. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give you a hundred dollars for him,&#8221;
      says he, careless-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, sir; he&#8217;s not for sale,&#8221; says Nolan, but his
      eyes get very big. The gentleman he walked away; but I watches him, and he
      talks to a man in a golf-cap, and by and by the man comes along our
      street, looking at all the dogs, and stops in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;This your dog?&#8221; says he to Nolan. &#8220;Pity he&#8217;s so
      leggy,&#8221; says he. &#8220;If he had a good tail, and a longer stop,
      and his ears were set higher, he&#8217;d be a good dog. As he is, I&#8217;ll
      give you fifty dollars for him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the Master could speak, Miss Dorothy laughs and says: &#8220;You&#8217;re
      Mr. Polk&#8217;s kennel-man, I believe. Well, you tell Mr. Polk from me
      that the dog&#8217;s not for sale now any more than he was five minutes
      ago, and that when he is, he&#8217;ll have to bid against me for him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looks foolish at that, but he turns to Nolan quick-like. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
      give you three hundred for him,&#8221; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; whispers Miss Dorothy, like she was talking to
      herself. &#8220;That&#8217;s it, is it?&#8221; And she turns and looks at
      me just as though she had never seen me before. Nolan he was a-gaping,
      too, with his mouth open. But he holds me tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not for sale,&#8221; he growls, like he was frightened;
      and the man looks black and walks away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Nolan!&#8221; cries Miss Dorothy, &#8220;Mr. Polk knows more
      about bull-terriers than any amateur in America. What can he mean? Why,
      Kid is no more than a puppy! Three hundred dollars for a puppy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And he ain&#8217;t no thoroughbred, neither!&#8221; cries the
      Master. &#8220;He&#8217;s &#8216;Unknown,&#8217; ain&#8217;t he? Kid can&#8217;t
      help it, of course, but his mother, miss&#8211;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped my head. I couldn&#8217;t bear he should tell Miss Dorothy. I
      couldn&#8217;t bear she should know I had stolen my blue ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Master never told, for at that a gentleman runs up, calling,
      &#8220;Three twenty-six, three twenty-six!&#8221; And Miss Dorothy says,
      &#8220;Here he is; what is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The Winners&#8217; class,&#8221; says the gentleman. &#8220;Hurry,
      please; the judge is waiting for him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nolan tries to get me off the chain on to a showing-leash, but he shakes
      so, he only chokes me. &#8220;What is it, miss?&#8221; he says. &#8220;What
      is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The Winners&#8217; class,&#8221; says Miss Dorothy. &#8220;The
      judge wants him with the winners of the other classes&#8211;to decide
      which is the best. It&#8217;s only a form,&#8221; says she. &#8220;He has
      the champions against him now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; says the gentleman, as he hurries us to the ring.
      &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s only a form for your dog, but the judge
      wants all the winners, puppy class even.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      We had got to the gate, and the gentleman there was writing down my
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who won the open?&#8221; asks Miss Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, who would?&#8221; laughs the gentleman. &#8220;The old
      champion, of course. He&#8217;s won for three years now. There he is. Isn&#8217;t
      he wonderful?&#8221; says he; and he points to a dog that&#8217;s standing
      proud and haughty on the platform in the middle of the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never see so beautiful a dog&#8211;so fine and clean and noble, so white
      like he had rolled hisself in flour, holding his nose up and his eyes
      shut, same as though no one was worth looking at. Aside of him we other
      dogs, even though we had a blue ribbon apiece, seemed like lumps of mud.
      He was a royal gentleman, a king, he was. His master didn&#8217;t have to
      hold his head with no leash. He held it hisself, standing as still as an
      iron dog on a lawn, like he knew all the people was looking at him. And so
      they was, and no one around the ring pointed at no other dog but him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, what a picture!&#8221; cried Miss Dorothy. &#8220;He&#8217;s
      like a marble figure by a great artist&#8211;one who loved dogs. Who is
      he?&#8221; says she, looking in her book. &#8220;I don&#8217;t keep up
      with terriers.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, you know him,&#8221; says the gentleman. &#8220;He is the
      champion of champions, Regent Royal.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Master&#8217;s face went red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And this is Regent Royal&#8217;s son,&#8221; cries he, and he pulls
      me quick into the ring, and plants me on the platform next my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trembled so that I near fell. My legs twisted like a leash. But my
      father he never looked at me. He only smiled the same sleepy smile, and he
      still kept his eyes half shut, like as no one, no, not even his own son,
      was worth his lookin&#8217; at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge he didn&#8217;t let me stay beside my father, but, one by one,
      he placed the other dogs next to him and measured and felt and pulled at
      them. And each one he put down, but he never put my father down. And then
      he comes over and picks up me and sets me back on the platform, shoulder
      to shoulder with the Champion Regent Royal, and goes down on his knees,
      and looks into our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with my father he laughs, and says to the judge, &#8220;Thinking
      of keeping us here all day, John?&#8221; But the judge he doesn&#8217;t
      hear him, and goes behind us and runs his hand down my side, and holds
      back my ears, and takes my jaws between his fingers. The crowd around the
      ring is very deep now, and nobody says nothing. The gentleman at the
      score-table, he is leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees and his
      eyes very wide, and the gentleman at the gate is whispering quick to Miss
      Dorothy, who has turned white. I stood as stiff as stone. I didn&#8217;t
      even breathe. But out of the corner of my eye I could see my father
      licking his pink chops, and yawning just a little, like he was bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge he had stopped looking fierce and was looking solemn. Something
      inside him seemed a-troubling him awful. The more he stares at us now, the
      more solemn he gets, and when he touches us he does it gentle, like he was
      patting us. For a long time he kneels in the sawdust, looking at my father
      and at me, and no one around the ring says nothing to nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the judge takes a breath and touches me sudden. &#8220;It&#8217;s
      his,&#8221; he says. But he lays his hand just as quick on my father.
      &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman holding my father cries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you mean to tell me&#8211;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the judge he answers, &#8220;I mean the other is the better dog.&#8221;
      He takes my father&#8217;s head between his hands and looks down at him
      most sorrowful. &#8220;The king is dead,&#8221; says he. &#8220;Long live
      the king! Good-by, Regent,&#8221; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd around the railings clapped their hands, and some laughed
      scornful, and every one talks fast, and I start for the gate, so dizzy
      that I can&#8217;t see my way. But my father pushes in front of me,
      walking very daintily, and smiling sleepy, same as he had just been waked,
      with his head high and his eyes shut, looking at nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is how I &#8220;came by my inheritance,&#8221; as Miss Dorothy
      calls it; and just for that, though I couldn&#8217;t feel where I was any
      different, the crowd follows me to my bench, and pats me, and coos at me,
      like I was a baby in a baby-carriage. And the handlers have to hold
      &#8217;em back so that the gentlemen from the papers can make pictures of
      me, and Nolan walks me up and down so proud, and the men shake their heads
      and says, &#8220;He certainly is the true type, he is!&#8221; And the
      pretty ladies ask Miss Dorothy, who sits beside me letting me lick her
      gloves to show the crowd what friends we is, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
      afraid he&#8217;ll bite you?&#8221; And Jimmy Jocks calls to me, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
      I tell you so? I always knew you were one of us. Blood will out, Kid;
      blood will out. I saw your grandfather,&#8221; says he, &#8220;make his
      début at the Crystal Palace. But he was never the dog you are!&#8221;

      After that, if I could have asked for it, there was nothing I couldn&#8217;t
      get. You might have thought I was a snow-dog, and they was afeard I&#8217;d
      melt. If I wet my pats, Nolan gave me a hot bath and chained me to the
      stove; if I couldn&#8217;t eat my food, being stuffed full by the cook&#8211;for
      I am a house-dog now, and let in to lunch, whether there is visitors or
      not,&#8211;Nolan would run to bring the vet. It was all tommy rot, as
      Jimmy says, but meant most kind. I couldn&#8217;t scratch myself
      comfortable, without Nolan giving me nasty drinks, and rubbing me outside
      till it burnt awful; and I wasn&#8217;t let to eat bones for fear of
      spoiling my &#8220;beautiful&#8221; mouth, what mother used to call my
      &#8220;punishing jaw&#8221;; and my food was cooked special on a
      gas-stove; and Miss Dorothy gives me an overcoat, cut very stylish like
      the champions&#8217;, to wear when we goes out carriage-driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the next Show, where I takes three blue ribbons, four silver cups,
      two medals, and brings home forty-five dollars for Nolan, they gives me a
      &#8220;registered&#8221; name, same as Jimmy&#8217;s. Miss Dorothy wanted
      to call me &#8220;Regent Heir Apparent&#8221;; but I was <i>that</i> glad
      when Nolan says, &#8220;No; Kid don&#8217;t owe nothing to his father,
      only to you and hisself. So, if you please, miss, we&#8217;ll call him
      Wyndham Kid.&#8221; And so they did, and you can see it on my overcoat in
      blue letters, and painted top of my kennel. It was all too hard to
      understand. For days I just sat and wondered if I was really me, and how
      it all come about, and why everybody was so kind. But oh, it was so good
      they was, for if they hadn&#8217;t been I&#8217;d never have got the thing
      I most wished after. But, because they was kind, and not liking to deny me
      nothing, they gave it me, and it was more to me than anything in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came about one day when we was out driving. We was in the cart they
      calls the dog-cart because it&#8217;s the one Miss Dorothy keeps to take
      Jimmy and me for an airing. Nolan was up behind, and me, in my new
      overcoat, was sitting beside Miss Dorothy. I was admiring the view, and
      thinking how good it was to have a horse pull you about so that you needn&#8217;t
      get yourself splashed and have to be washed, when I hears a dog calling
      loud for help, and I pricks up my ears and looks over the horse&#8217;s
      head. And I sees something that makes me tremble down to my toes. In the
      road before us three big dogs was chasing a little old lady-dog. She had a
      string to her tail, where some boys had tied a can, and she was dirty with
      mud and ashes, and torn most awful. She was too far done up to get away,
      and too old to help herself, but she was making a fight for her life,
      snapping her old gums savage, and dying game. All this I see in a wink,
      and then the three dogs pinned her down, and I can&#8217;t stand it no
      longer, and clears the wheel and lands in the road on my head. It was my
      stylish overcoat done that, and I cursed it proper, but I gets my pats
      again quick, and makes a rush for the fighting. Behind me I hear Miss
      Dorothy cry: &#8220;They&#8217;ll kill that old dog. Wait, take my whip.
      Beat them off her! The Kid can take care of himself&#8221;; and I hear
      Nolan fall into the road, and the horse come to a stop. The old lady-dog
      was down, and the three was eating her vicious; but as I come up,
      scattering the pebbles, she hears, and thinking it&#8217;s one more of
      them, she lifts her head, and my heart breaks open like some one had sunk
      his teeth in it. For, under the ashes and the dirt and the blood, I can
      see who it is, and I know that my mother has come back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gives a yell that throws them three dogs off their legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother!&#8221; I cries. &#8220;I&#8217;m the Kid,&#8221; I cries.
      &#8220;I&#8217;m coming to you. Mother, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I shoots over her at the throat of the big dog, and the other two they
      sinks their teeth into that stylish overcoat and tears it off me, and that
      sets me free, and I lets them have it. I never had so fine a fight as
      that! What with mother being there to see, and not having been let to mix
      up in no fights since I become a prize-winner, it just naturally did me
      good, and it wasn&#8217;t three shakes before I had &#8217;em yelping.
      Quick as a wink, mother she jumps in to help me, and I just laughed to see
      her. It was so like old times. And Nolan he made me laugh, too. He was
      like a hen on a bank, shaking the butt of his whip, but not daring to cut
      in for fear of hitting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop it, Kid,&#8221; he says, &#8220;stop it. Do you want to be all
      torn up?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Think of the Boston Show,&#8221; says he.
      &#8220;Think of Chicago. Think of Danbury. Don&#8217;t you never want to
      be a champion?&#8221; How was I to think of all them places when I had
      three dogs to cut up at the same time? But in a minute two of &#8217;em
      begs for mercy, and mother and me lets &#8217;em run away. The big one he
      ain&#8217;t able to run away. Then mother and me we dances and jumps, and
      barks and laughs, and bites each other and rolls each other in the road.
      There never was two dogs so happy as we. And Nolan he whistles and calls
      and begs me to come to him; but I just laugh and play larks with mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, you come with me,&#8221; says I, &#8220;to my new home, and
      never try to run away again.&#8221; And I shows her our house with the
      five red roofs, set on the top of the hill. But mother trembles awful, and
      says: &#8220;They&#8217;d never let me in such a place. Does the Viceroy
      live there, Kid?&#8221; says she. And I laugh at her. &#8220;No; I do,&#8221;
      I says. &#8220;And if they won&#8217;t let you live there, too, you and me
      will go back to the streets together, for we must never be parted no more.&#8221;
      So we trots up the hill side by side, with Nolan trying to catch me, and
      Miss Dorothy laughing at him from the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The Kid&#8217;s made friends with the poor old dog,&#8221; says
      she. &#8220;Maybe he knew her long ago when he ran the streets himself.
      Put her in here beside me, and see if he doesn&#8217;t follow.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I hears that I tells mother to go with Nolan and sit in the cart;
      but she says no&#8211;that she&#8217;d soil the pretty lady&#8217;s frock;
      but I tells her to do as I say, and so Nolan lifts her, trembling still,
      into the cart, and I runs alongside, barking joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we drives into the stables I takes mother to my kennel, and tells her
      to go inside it and make herself at home. &#8220;Oh, but he won&#8217;t
      let me!&#8221; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who won&#8217;t let you?&#8221; says I, keeping my eye on Nolan,
      and growling a bit nasty, just to show I was meaning to have my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Wyndham Kid,&#8221; says she, looking up at the name on my
      kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I&#8217;m Wyndham Kid!&#8221; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You!&#8221; cries mother. &#8220;You! Is my little Kid the great
      Wyndham Kid the dogs all talk about?&#8221; And at that, she being very
      old, and sick, and nervous, as mothers are, just drops down in the straw
      and weeps bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there ain&#8217;t much more than that to tell. Miss Dorothy she
      settled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If the Kid wants the poor old thing in the stables,&#8221; says
      she, &#8220;let her stay.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You see,&#8221; says she, &#8220;she&#8217;s a black-and-tan, and
      his mother was a black-and-tan, and maybe that&#8217;s what makes Kid feel
      so friendly toward her,&#8221; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Indeed, for me,&#8221; says Nolan, &#8220;she can have the best
      there is. I&#8217;d never drive out no dog that asks for a crust nor a
      shelter,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But what will Mr. Wyndham do?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;ll do what I say,&#8221; says Miss Dorothy, &#8220;and if
      I say she&#8217;s to stay, she will stay, and I say&#8211;she&#8217;s to
      stay!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so mother and Nolan and me found a home. Mother was scared at first&#8211;not
      being used to kind people; but she was so gentle and loving that the
      grooms got fonder of her than of me, and tried to make me jealous by
      patting of her and giving her the pick of the vittles. But that was the
      wrong way to hurt my feelings. That&#8217;s all, I think. Mother is so
      happy here that I tell her we ought to call it the Happy Hunting Grounds,
      because no one hunts you, and there is nothing to hunt; it just all comes
      to you. And so we live in peace, mother sleeping all day in the sun, or
      behind the stove in the head groom&#8217;s office, being fed twice a day
      regular by Nolan, and all the day by the other grooms most irregular. And
      as for me, I go hurrying around the country to the bench-shows, winning
      money and cups for Nolan, and taking the blue ribbons away from father.
